_This is an essay from my undergraduate years at the London School of Economics. I thought maybe someone could use it, in whatever way. Beware academic language._

This paper will focus on FDR’s domestic and foreign policy decisions by comparing and contrasting his achievements in so far as demonstrating that his foreign policies during wartime were more successful than his domestic policies during peacetime. I will contrast his primary wartime achievement, emerging as victor of WWII and overcoming the Nazi totalitarian threat, with his primary peacetime achievement, the New Deal of relief, recovery and reform. I will demonstrate why his wartime achievement succeeded and why his peacetime achievement failed. In particular, failure and success is relative in so far as his peacetime achievements did not necessarily fail, but his foreign policies were more successful in comparison with his domestic policies. Further Roosevelt’s foreign policy was successful because it led to positive results by leading an isolated United States to intervene in WWII and stifle the totalitarian threat by the axis powers.

Although there is a debate among historians on whether Roosevelt should have intervened earlier or not, most historians do not question the success of the foreign policies itself. Roosevelt’s domestic policies, as Kennedy indicates, remain a source of controversy and debate amongst economist and historians. For example, as Shlaes suggests, it is not right to overlook the consequences of the president’s policies because of the hypothesis, which has been adamantly proposed by scholars over the decades, that democracy would have failed in America without the New Deal. Therefore my aim is to show the contrast between FDR’s relative failure in domestic policy and his relative success in foreign policy, and display his shift in focus from domestic during peacetime to foreign policy during wartime.

FDR’s achievement in domestic policy was not successful because Roosevelt prescribed the wrong medicine. A doctor who recognizes the wrong symptoms cannot prescribe the right medicine to cure the disease of a patient. The New Deal, which was FDR’s medicine and milestone of his domestic policy, did not attack the crux of the issue. The Great Depression began as an ordinary recession after the stock market crashed in October of 1929, but both Hoover and Roosevelt protracted that recession and eventually turned it into a recession.

Friedman and Schwartz argued that the economic contraction was exacerbated because of the bank failures and the massive withdrawals of currency from the financial system while the Federal Reserve did not provide the necessary liquidity that the system required. At the same time, Roosevelt was enlarging the public sector. For example, an opportunity to light up the South was existing for Wilkie’s company, Commonwealth and Southern, but the government created the Tennessee Valley Authority which the Commonwealth and Southern could not compete with. As a result, businesses decided to hold on to their money and not invest it, but Roosevelt got their money by taxing them. Thus, the government spending skewed competition in the private sector and Roosevelt’s call for “bold, persistent experimentation” was not sending signals of confidence to the business community.

For example, the volatility of the stock market 1929 was very high which shows that the private sector was very nervous because they feared Roosevelt’s next policy decision. In 1937-38, the U.S. economy dipped back into recession, and unemployment remained above 10%. As Einhorn suggests, the lesson of the “Roosevelt recession” of 1937-38 is that GDP created by massive fiscal stimulus is artificial, and that is exactly what the New Deal achieved. It temporarily brought the economy out of recession, but did not solve the underlying problem. Jones argues that the New Deal did not bring much benefit to some of the most disadvantaged groups such as sharecroppers, small farmers and rural unemployed.

Shlaes suggests that Roosevelt’s domestic policies failed because he created regulatory aid, and relief agencies based on the premise that recovery could be achieved only through a large military-style effort. However, the key to sustained recovery was not the public sector, but the private sector. The essence to economic growth is not state led government spending, but entrepreneurship and innovation from the private sector through gains in capital, labor and productivity. For example, The National Recovery Administration discouraged employers to hire more workers in so far as high wages although helping those that were employed prevented companies to hire additional workers. Shlaes indicates that New Deal laws themselves contributed to the sense of lost opportunity and Roosevelt offered rhetorical optimism, but pessimism underlay his policies.

However the fact that the Depression lasted so long almost invalidates any success of the New Deal. The few benefits do not outweigh the cost of the New Deal. However, Roosevelt inherited the crisis from his predecessor Hoover who exacerbated had exacerbated the crisis since 1929, so in a sense Roosevelt’s success for domestic policies was limited to begin with. Fortunately, some of his domestic policies created lasting value for the United States, which Americans are still using today.

FDR’s achievement in domestic policy was not entirely unsuccessful. The Roosevelt administration surely had good intentions and some of the programs that came out of the New Deal benefited the U.S. economy in the long run. The first bills that passed in the first hundred days were characteristic of the New Deal in so far as they displayed Roosevelt, as Jones indicates, not as a doctrinaire but an experimenter and improviser. Hofstadter described the New Deal as a series of improvisations, many adopted very suddenly, many contradictory.

His Emergency Banking Relief Bill, as Jones suggests, placed all banks under federal control and arranged for the reopening under license of those found to be solvent. Throughout his presidency, Roosevelt delivered his fireside speeches, which were not domestic policies in itself, but helped to establish a relationship with the American public. Further, Roosevelt included artists in the benefits of the Works Progress Administration. He initiated work-relief projects which improved infrastructure and schools. The Public Works Administration created hospitals, bridges, roads and other public buildings. He strengthened the banking structure by passing the Glass-Steagall Banking Act which separated commercial banks from investment banks. Further he created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation which guaranteed individual deposits and initiated the Securities and Exchange Commission which would regulate stock exchanges and effectively becoming the sheriff on Wall Street. Although Roosevelt’s New Deal arguably brought some benefits, as well as costs, FDR’s achievements in domestic policy on balance remained negative. It was only his success in his foreign policy decisions that would tide the turn for Roosevelt’s legacy.

FDR’s achievement in foreign policy was more successful than his domestic policies on account of the shift to foreign policy which gradually shifted the United States from being isolationist to interventionist and ultimately led the nation into World War II and suppress the totalitarian threat by the Nazis. The Roosevelt administration had the susceptibility to maneuver a country, which was looking inwards, into a war which remedied its domestic issues and stifled a threat that was endangering not only Europe but the entire world.

For a long time, Roosevelt was concerned about domestic issues, especially recovering from the Great Depression. Therefore the shift from domestic to foreign policy only occurred gradually when the perception of the totalitarian threat changed. Hofstadter emphasizes that he was in no mood to try to remold the dominant isolationist and pacifist feeling of the country. Although Roosevelt’s foreign policy allowed aiding and rearmament, the United States did not fully intervene until it perceived the totalitarian threat by the Axis as an acute danger to the United States. Between 1935 and 1939 there were four Neutrality Acts, which enabled to aid allies and can be regarded as small steps leading the United States from isolation towards intervention. Further the rearmament occurred slowly and Roosevelt had to justify the purpose of rearmament in so far as it was not only a means to aid allies but also a way to protect the United States itself.

Thus, when America became aware of its military weakness and vulnerability, Roosevelt, in 1938, called for rearmament and congress passed the Naval Expansion Act of May 1938, which authorized the expenditure of over one billion dollar over the next decade to create a naval army. However, Roosevelt’s hatred towards fascism and his willingness to aid Britain faced strong disapproval from Americans who opposed intervention at any rate. Maier argues that Roosevelt intuitively did not like fascism, but there were enough in America who liked it or thought it was no the business of America to interfere. For example, “America First” was such a group that opposed entry of the United States into World War II. The ambiguity of U.S. foreign policy sprang from Roosevelt’s third election as president in which he promised not to enter the war. Until the United States did enter the war, not much was actually done to stop dictators such as Hitler or Stalin because Roosevelt was distracted by the Great Depression and the negative repercussions of World War I. Jones (490) notes that American foreign policy in the 1930s was unheroic as it may unwittingly have helped the Axis powers and reinforced British and French appeasement.

Roosevelt wanted to help but avoid hostilities at the same time. For example, the Roosevelt administration was cautious to provoke Japan because Roosevelt did not want to fight the war in two oceans. However when Japan began to march into Southeast Asia, it was difficult for the U.S. to intervene without provoking military repercussions. In order to stop Japan from advancing into Chinese territories such as Manchuria, Roosevelt, by exercising an oil embargo on Japan, ultimately used U.S. foreign policy to force Japan out of Southeast Asia. However the embargo indirectly led to the attack on Pearl Harbor which in turn precipitated U.S. intervention into World War II. When Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, U.S. foreign policy became the focus of the Roosevelt administration.

There is a debate on whether the Roosevelt administration knew about the attack on Pearl Harbor. Isolationists even accuse him of provoking Japan to attack the United States. However, even though Roosevelt might have known that an attack by the Japanese was imminent, there was no way to really know where they would strike. Most importantly when the U.S. officially entered World War II, Americans changed their views on the isolationist vs. interventionist debate and began to see the war against totalitarianism as a just war for human freedom.

Although it transformed the U.S. from isolationist nation to a leading international actor in the world, as Dougherty argues the war also brought profound changes in the linkage between domestic politics and foreign policy. Ferguson asserts that the United States were forced to make terrible compromises, using their own inhuman methods to defeat the Axis. For example, when fighting Japan they had to fight war cave by cave and adopting methods that the enemy was using against them.
