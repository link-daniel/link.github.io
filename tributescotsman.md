One of Niall’s great lectures. This photo was taken in 2013 during his lecture at the Harvard Club in Hong Kong.

O n the day of his last lecture at Harvard, I reflected on what I have learned from the prolific historian, whose leadership has inspired me in so many ways. As I have been immensely enriched by this great Scotsman, I feel compelled to express my gratitude in this short piece.

Following over a decade teaching in Cambridge, MA, Niall Ferguson is embarking on a new journey, which coincides with another turning point in economic history. At Stanford in California, he will be a full-time senior fellow at the American public policy think tank Hoover Institution. “This is also a chance for me to get a closer view and, I hope, a better understanding of the extraordinary things that are going on at Stanford and in Silicon Valley,” he explained on Facebook last year. “The economic historian in me cannot help but be fascinated.”

As anyone who is familiar with his work, Niall Ferguson is a rockstar academic and so much more. Not only is he the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University, he is also a senior fellow both at Stanford and Oxford. He has published fourteen books and released multiple documentaries. He is a regular contributor and commentator on global politics and economics. In 2010, he was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Prize for Public Service and in 2012 the Hayek Prize for Lifetime Achievement. In short, he embodies excellence.

I was an undergraduate student at the London School of Economics, when I heard that Prof. Ferguson would teach for a semester at my university. I was so excited when I first heard the news. I had absorbed all his books and documentaries by then. Here was someone that in a refreshingly contrarian way could help me understand how the world really worked. There was something about the way he made very complex matters accessible.

Every Friday afternoon, he taught a class called “Western Ascendancy” that was overflown with students due to its popularity. At its core, the class was helping students to understand the mainsprings of Western power. Every week I looked forward to this class. Indeed I was so eager to learn more that I volunteered to lead a class section. Understanding the global economy can be difficult at times, but he taught in such an engaging way that you were compelled to learn more. What an exciting way to learn history.

I still remember the first class. It was a class room that was definitely not fit to host a teacher of his calibre. The room was so packed that people sat on the floor and stood by the sidelines. For fifty minutes or so, everyone would listen in eagerly. Prof. Ferguson would illustrate his points with stories and engage students with questions. At the end of the lecture, people would go to talk to him. Some would ask him for an autograph for one of his books. It felt like visiting a concert rather than a classroom. It felt like that after almost every class. Whenever class ended, just getting a hold of him for a question was a challenge.

During the semester, students would sometimes complain that he wasn’t available all the time. I learned, however, to see this as a trade-off. In light of his commitments all over the world, we should appreciate the time we had with someone of his stature. And when he was there he was present and in service of his students.

Over time, as I got to know Prof. Ferguson better, I would come to appreciate his work ethic, his drive for excellence and so many other things that are hard to describe. For example, his ability to combine so many different trees of knowledge to come up with unique insights. Whether engaging students or world leaders, he was committed to move other people’s thinking forward.

In that way, he exceeded beyond measure. He was the teacher that everyone could hope for. He inspired me to learn even more, and to understand even better the forces and dynamics that underpin our global world. He knows how to engage and capture an audience. Every lecture was a perfect combination of performance, education and inspiration.

By moving my thinking forward, he accomplished what the greatest teachers should strive for. He led by example and inspired me and other students to reach higher levels. This is the purpose of a teacher. He challenged me to think bigger and this is no small accomplishment indeed.
