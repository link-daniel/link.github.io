“From each as they chose, to each as they are chosen” — Robert Nozick

This is a brief on Robert Nozick and his work on political theory that I prepared for my exam on political philosophy at the London School of Economics. May it help you in whatever way you deem necessary. It’s not complete, but it’s quite extensive.

It covers Nozick’s conception of the state, Nozick on goals and side constraints and distributive justice. This is a resource, not an essay.
“Critiques Of” includes philosophers or ideas that challenge the topic. “Importance Of” explains the most important points on the topic from the philosopher’s point of view. And “Excerpts Of”, as the name suggests, offers a few quotes by the philosopher.

NOZICK BRIEF

DEFINITIONS
Libertarianism = the view that an individual has a right to do whatever he/she wishes, without interference. Nozick argues that this need not entail anarchy, but requires a state. However, the only justifiable state is one which is a mid-way between anarchy and a state which redistributes goods. Individuals acquire title in various ways, and it would violate their rights were the state, or anybody else, to take them away. This is his “entitlement theory of justice”.

Libertarians favor unfettered markets and oppose government regulation, not in the same name of economic efficiency but in the same of human freedom. Their central claim is that each of us has a fundamental right to liberty — the right to do whatever we want with the things we own, provided we respect other people’s rights to do the same.

### I NOZICK’S CONCEPTION OF THE STATE
‘Opposition to Anarchism’ Against the anarchist, some sort of state is justified. People in a state of nature would naturally develop something like a state without violating anybody’s rights, and would be better off with such a state. People would band together to form protective agencies and these would grow larger until they resemble nation states.

Opposition to the Nightwatchman State

The Minimal State: Aims only to protect people’s rights. But protection is provided by taking from some to protect others: redistribution. This redistribution forces some to do things they may not have chosen, and so violates their rights.

The Ultraminimal State: Only state that would naturally emerge, and is justifiable. Intermediate between protective agencies and minimal state. Protects only those who choose to pay for its services. Claims a monopoly on force amongst those who pay. Doesn’t violate rights because no genuine redistribution goes on. Rather those who pay taxes are compensating those who do not for violations of their liberties.

Unlike any existing states: Defense, policing, enforcement of contracts are only functions. No public services (e.g. infrastructure), welfare (e.g. health services), prohibitions (e.g. censorship) But it’s not that bad. Philanthropy is welcomed (though not required)

Provides a “framework for utopia”, since it can sustain some very different systems which might be freely chosen, e.g. communes, free markets…
Opposition to the Ultraminimal State

The rights of those who do not subscribe to the state have their rights violated. If they were forced to enjoy the state’s protection, though one right (to choose) would be violated, others would be protected. So the ultraminimal state fails to achieve its aim of protecting rights. How does Nozick answer this criticism

The libertarian rejects three types of policies and laws that modern states commonly enact:
1. No paternalism 2. No Morals Legislation 3. No Redistribution of Income or Wealth
Only a minimal state, limited to enforcing contracts and protecting people against force, theft and fraud, is justified. Any more extensive state violates persons’ rights not to be forced to do certain things, and is unjustified. (Nozick, 1974)

### II NOZICK ON GOALS AND SIDE CONSTRAINTS
Goal Directed: What is right is what produces the best outcome or “end-state” E.g. Utilitarianism, which violates rights

A “Utilitarianism of Rights”, which seeks to minimize rights violations. Even this allows some rights to be violated. (the mob and innocent man example)

Using someone for the “greater good” is an error because of the “seperatedness of persons”

There is no “super-person” who benefits, just individual people

The person who is used is not compensated, and nobody can force somebody else to make a sacrifice. Goal-directed views do not recognize this seperateness.

Side Constraints:
Some actions are simply forbidden, no matter what the outcome (including preventing more such actions)

The contract between negative rights (e.g. non-interference) and positive rights (e.g. to be provided with food)

Supported by Kantian principle that individuals are ends and not merely means.

A rejection of the goal-directed morality is the basis of Nozick’s critique of the Minimal state. It will also answer the initial objection.
But which side constraints will the libertarian adopt?

Some principle prohibiting physical aggression looks promising. But Nozick candidly admits that there may be serious problems with even this.
Paternalism: we might use force against someone for their own good

Innocent threats: e.g. defending oneself against innocent thrown down well

Innocent shields: e.g. innocent strapped to an aggressor’s tank

The Experience Machine: Nozick’s famous thought experiment. You can set the machine to give you whatever experiences you like a couple of years. Would you plug in? The idea is supposed to pose a problem for hedonistic Utilitarian views, that some sort of experience is not all what matters to us. Nozick suggests we might also want: To actually do some things, To be a certain way, To have a real relationships with others

A Rationale for Side Constraint View: One must be “a being able to formulate long-term plans for its life, able to consider and decide on the basis of abstrat principles or considerations it formulates to itself and hence not merely the plaything of immediate stimuli, a being that limits its own behavior in accordance with some principles or picture it has of what an appropriate life is for itself, and others, and so on.”

#### III NOZICK ON DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE
The Entitlement Theory of Justice: the following inductive definition would exhaustively cover the subject of justice in holdings: A person who acquires a holding in accordance with the principle of justice in acquisition is entitled to that holding. A person who acquires a holding in accordance with the principle of justice in transfer, from someone else entitled to that holding, is entitled to the holding.

No one is entitled to a holding except by (repeated) applications of 1 and 2.

Nozick’s theory requires three principles: Justice in Acquisition — Nozick uses a Lockean account, It asks if the resources you used to make your money were legitimately yours in the first place. Justice in Transfer — how one can justly acquire holdings from others (e.g. gifts, purchase, exchange, inheritance) Not much detail provided by Nozick. It asks if you made your money either through free exchanges in the marketplace or from gift voluntarily bestowed upon you by others.

Justice in Rectification — how to put right an unjust state of holdings. Not spelled out by Nozick.

Historical vs. Current Time Slice Accounts

Historical: The justice of a distribution depends on how it actually came about. E.g. criminal justice — punishment presupposes desert. E.g. Marxism — workers entitled to fruits of their labours.

Current Time Slice: the justice of a distribution depends only on how things are distributed at a given time. E.g. welfare economics — irrelevant how people became needy. E.g. End-state principles — e.g. Utilitarianism

Patterned vs. Unpatterned Accounts. 

Patterned accounts: justice in holdings a matter of instantiating the right pattern
“To think that the task of a theory of distributive justice is to fill in the blank in ‘to each according to his ___’ is to be predisposed to search for a pattern.”

The blank might be labor, need, merit, etc.

Patterned accounts may or may not be historical. Non-historical patterns include “to each according to IQ.

Nozick rejects patterned theories of justice in favor of those that honor the choices people make in free markets. He argues that distributive justice depends on two requirements — justice in initial holdings and justice in transfer (Sandel, 2006)

Locke on Acquisition

Nozick’s historical account depends upon saying how we acquire title to goods prior to any transfers. He endorses Locke’s theory of entitlement, according to which one acquires title to something by mixing one’s labor with it.

Previously unowned parts of nature come to be owned when we improve them by our own labor. E.g. I come to own a field by tending it.

The sacrifice I make entitles me to it. Cf. pouring tomato juice into the sea

Shouldn’t this only entitle us to the added value? No such scheme has been devised, and how could it?

But we need further constraints in conditions of scarcity, because coming to own something might limit the opportunities of others.

The Lockean Proviso: we must leave “enough and as good left in common for others”

Nozick argues that a system of private property satisfies the Lockean proviso: experimentation is encouraged; specialized kinds of risk bearing are encouraged; future generations are protected because some reserve for future markets; It makes it easier for the unpopular to get a job. Thus, no person would be made worse off. But: worse off than what? Where is the baseline? How doe we decide what the “state of nature” would be like?
The notion of self-ownership is appealing, especially for those who seek a strong foundation for individual rights. The idea that I belong to myself, not to the state or political community, is one way of explaining why it is wrong to sacrifice my rights for the welfare of others.

Against Patterned Accounts: Wilt Chamberlain

Assume we have a just distribution, D1…

Wilt Chamberlain is greatly in demand by basketball teams, being a great gate attraction … [and] signs the following sort of contract with a team: In each home game twenty-five cents from the price of each ticket of admission goes to him. … Let us suppose that in one session one million persons attend his home games, and Wilt Chamberlain ends up with $250,000, a much larger sum than the average income and larger even than anyone else has. Is he entitled to this income? Is this new distribution D2 unjust?

Nozick argues that since the audience members were all entitled to their money (D1 was just), and each chose to spend their money (the transfer from D1 to D2 was just), then D2 must be just.

According to Nozick, libertarians must reject patterned accounts because:

Transfers can be voluntary. A new pattern will emerge from any voluntary transfer. Prohibiting voluntary transfers would seriously interfere with liberty, as would redistributing goods to restore D1.
