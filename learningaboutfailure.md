Me and my friend years ago had this amazing idea of building a localized social network, where you could meet people locally anywhere. People feel lonely, but we wanted to solve that. We were sitting at an apartment in Midtown Manhattan, and we were wondering about all these people that were staying in their apartment. We asked ourselves what they were doing. I always was surprised that people can live so close to each other and still be distant to each other at the same time.

Often the media portrays the successful startups, and we forget the many that failed. Ours has failed. Perhaps it couldn’t even have been called a startup. It was just a side project, and that by itself is fine. The reason why it didn’t work was not because it was a side project. It was lack of commitment, and understanding what was expected of one another. Actually finding the cause of its failure is another tricky endeavor.

Overall, however, we can learn more when we inquire about people’s failures than their success. Success is always masked and can never really be reconstructed perfectly. We learn more by understanding why people failed.
