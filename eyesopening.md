My eyes are opening. Waking up in London at 8:30AM. Rise and shine. Strolling along the Thames and walking to my internship. What a beautiful day. Arriving at the trading floor and watching the markets. Futures up, everything looks good. Looking out the window onto London Tower Bridge, and thinking about New York for a moment. Time is running fast. Leaving in the afternoon. Meeting a friend at Starbucks. Sipping coffee and having a good time. Looking at my watch. It is late. Gotta catch my flight. Running and singing through the streets in a gloomy and rainy London. Just in time to get my bus. Opening up my laptop and checking Gmail and Facebook. Arriving at the airport an hour later. Just another airport I have not been to. Getting through security and taking the shuttle train to the gate. Meeting a stranger, chilling at the lounge and waiting. Some time to reflect on what I experienced over the past months and all the great people I met. Last call. Mr. Daniel? Merry Christmas and have a safe journey. Flying home to visit family for Christmas. Going to sleep for a bit and my eyes are closing.
