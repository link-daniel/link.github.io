The Only Resource You’ll Ever Need
This is a brief on Aristotle and his Politics that I prepared for my exam on political philosophy at the London School of Economics. May it help you in whatever way you need to prepare for Aristotle. It’s not complete, but covers most areas.
It covers Aristotle on topics of the constitution, the good life, and political participation. “Critiques Of” includes philosophers or ideas that challenge the topic. “Importance Of” explains the most important points on the topic from the philosopher’s point of view. And “Excerpts Of”, as the name suggests, offers a few quotes by the philosopher.

### I CONSTITUTION

#### CRITIQUES OF:
Kant/Rawls: Because people disagree in pluralistic societies about the nature of the good life, we should not try to base justice on any particular answer to that question. They reject teleology; they reject the idea of tying justice to some conception of the good. Rawls rejects teleological accounts of justice; it threatens the equal rights of citizens.
Shouldn’t it be up to us to define what our lives are?
Sandel (2005): If you tie justice to a particular conception of the good, a fit between a person and his or her role, you do not leave room for freedom.
Sandel: Justice, rights and constitutions should not be based on any notion of the common good or the purposes of life but should instead provide a framework of rights that leaves people free to choose their conceptions of the good and purposes of their life.
Sandel: “No comedian can be successful only by reading a book on the principles of comedy.”
Johnson (1990): “Principle of distributive justice”
The polis does not maximize the creation of wealth nor the promotion of liberty and equality (according to Aristotle, wealth is a means to an end, but happiness is an end itself.)
MacIntyre: Aristotle is “an exponent of virtue ethics”
Rawls: Aristotle is some kind of ‘ethical consequentialist’
Miller Jr.: “A natural-law theorist who recognizes the existence of a universally valid standard of justice that might be used to critically evaluate positive law.”
Kelsen: An ethical relativist whose view resemble closely the modern doctrine of legal positivism.

#### IMPORTANCE OF:
Link between distribution of citizenship and political authority and the purpose of politics: a) The telos of politics; what is politics about? It is about forming good character, cultivating the virtue of citizens; it’s about the good life, the end of the state is not mere economic, life, security, its realizing the good life. b) Then from that we can derive the principles of distributive justice, who should have the say c) Those who distribute most to an association of this character, namely an association that aims at the good, should have a greater share in political rule.
The one, the few or the many: the Aristotelian categories of political rule or some mixture of those three classes that constitute every city. The best constitution needs to be regulated according to its natural ruling principle.
Good vs. Bad: 1. Monarchy (ideal if we can find one person who is preeminent in virtue); 2.Aristocracy (the virtue is distributed among the few); monarchy and aristocracy are the best but as a full ideal they are rarely ever found. 3.Polity (constitutional government, the many have a say in ruling); 4.Tyranny; 5.Oligarchy; 6.Democracy (mob rule by the poor)
Standards of Distribution: A) wealth B) citizenship C) nobility, merit and excellence (moral goodness/virtue); standards of wealth and citizenship are not relevant standards for the purpose of this particular problem of distributive justice. This is just as arbitrary as giving more power to some people on the grounds that they are taller than others. Ruling is a job like any other and those who are best fitted to the job should be the ones to do it. The appropriate standard here is nobility, merit, or excellence that is to say moral goodness or virtue, an attribute which is distributed unequally and is possessed to the necessary degree by only a few people, who are therefore ‘the best’ at ruling.
The middle class: we hold office and are being ruled in turn to create an equal status; a mixture of the principles of oligarchy and democracy and it avoids dominance by either extreme; polity is characterized by the dominance of the middle class, the middle group who is able to achieve the confidence of both extreme parties where at least it is sufficiently numerous to avoid the problems of class struggle and factional conflict.
Mixed constitution as a balance of classes: if many govern they are less susceptible to corruption and factionalism, to self-interest, and to hatred of other classes of society. The polis is a shared venture in which everyone participates in order to achieve a common good. The people who are virtuous and good are balanced with the minority who are wealthy and educated.
The end of the regime: it is the task of political understanding to draw out what the standards of justice are and through educative means to cultivate the virtues and pass on the constitution to a new generation. The end of the regime is peace and the purpose of peace is leisure; leisure is necessary for education or what he sometimes calls by the term philosophy.
Nicomachean Ethics: there is only one constitution which is “naturally the best everywhere.”
In Aristotle’s view therefore the principles of political justice of a polis might correctly be said to constitute the standard of justice or of right and wrong for its citizens.

#### EXCERPTS OF:
“Equality must be equal for equals.”
“Justice involves two factors: things and the person to whom things are assigned. In general, we say that persons who are equal should have equal things assigned to them.”
“In the case of distribution of flutes, the best flute player should receive the best flute.”
“Law becomes a mere covenant, a guarantor of man’s rights against one another, instead of being — as it should be — a way of life such as will make the members of a polis good and just.”
“A polis is not an association for residents on a common site, or for the sake of preventing mutual injustice and easing exchange. The end and purpose of a polis is the good life, and the institutions of social life are means to that end.”
A man who is isolated, who is unable to share in the benefits of political association, or who has no end to share, because he is already self-sufficient, such a person must either be a beast or god.”

### II THE GOOD LIFE

Aristotle with A Bust of Homer by Rembrandt

#### CRITIQUES OF:
Plato: the good life is external and has to be brought by the philosophers, but for Aristotle the good is implicit in the constitution.
Aristotle’s conception of citizenship is elitist and hierarchical, because without noncitizens the system would not work. While a citizen is an end in itself, a noncitizen is means to an end. The leisure citizens enjoy is made possible only by the continuing toil of those beneath them. A class that engages in manual labor cannot be granted citizenship as they do not have the time to devote to education and self-improvement. Why should non-citizens accept this?
Haslip (2003): Aristotle excludes women.
If slaves are to follow orders and respond to commands, don’t they have then some kind of rationality?

#### IMPORTANCE OF:
Contemplative vs. Practical life: The good life of man is either contemplative (philosophers seeking knowledge) or practical (by a wisely judged cultivation and practice of virtue); city and practical reason are only means to the ultimate end of happiness found through the practice of pure, speculative reasoning;
Given what human beings are, we should take human happiness to consist in rational activity in line with the virtues (1) moral virtues (2) intellectual virtues. How do we become morally virtuous? Through habituation and learning to be morally good is a kind of ‘learning by doing’. Our actions determine our character, and morally virtuous is not acquired by nature.
Good life possible only in the polis: Natural emergence from family to household, village and finally city-state, or rather polis. The polis is the end and perfection of natural associations, and comes to be for the sake of life, and exists for the sake of the good life. The state has a task to make us better. The polis is the natural community within which man achieves his supremely human good. The good for man and the cultivation of human excellence is like the exercise of a skill and refinement of a talent. It requires activity application and education. It is political society that makes it possible for individual human beings to live a good life.
Not wealth maximization: the good life is not maximizing wealth as wealth is a means to an end. Those who pursue wealth as an end in itself lead to a worse life. This view explains his stance against usury being unnatural.
The Doctrine of the Mean: moral virtue is a mean state — it is intermediate between excess and deficiency of the emotion the state of character refers to. Feeling the relative emotion to the right degree, at the right time, concerning the right objectives, and with the right motive, thus taking into account the particular situation one is in.

#### CITIZENS INCLUDED IN:
Characteristic of a good citizen: deliberates and makes decisions; preserves the constitution by holding office and being ruled in turn; status is not a birthright, nor is it open to foreigners; the constitution determines who is eligible to be a citizen; the cultivation of judging wisely.
Features of a good citizen: male of thirty to forty years of age, of good health, of many friends, have many good children, enjoy beauty, strength, stature; and be fortunate enough not to experience illness, bereavement or isolation.

#### NON-CITIZENS EXCLUDED FROM:
Women: confined to the household and reproduction; they lack in intellect, passive and recipients of male activity; they do not have an entitlement in the public realm; they are distinct from slaves insofar as they are morally equally although they are practically inferior; but they can cultivate virtues.
Slaves: their work is necessary for creating enough leisure time for the citizens to enjoy happiness, but they themselves do not merit a share of this happiness. It has to be the case that there some people for whom slavery fits.
Natural vs. legal slaves.
Absence of rationality: absence of irrational will makes some people a natural slave. They require the external imposition of direction, which is the basis of natural slavery. There are those who need to be directed by others. Those people are not really people. Natural slaves, if they exist, exist in the household. The master exercises control over the slave as if it were an instrument. Slaves are tools that are used by the master, because they are a function of the master. The master possesses rational, commanding powers, while the slave, lacking these, is fit only to carry out menial duties. (by Kelly, 2010)

#### EXCERPTS OF:
“Whenever a thing is established out of a number of things and becomes a single common thing, there always appears in it a ruler and ruled.”

### III POLITICAL PARTICIPATION

“Aristotle” by Francesco Hayez (1791–1882)

#### CRITIQUES OF:
Why is it not possible to lead perfectly good lives without political participation? Aristotle’s belief that man can only become fully human when he engages in the political association of the city is a strongly communitarian view that would meet with heavy opposition from libertarian thinkers.
Coolidge: The business of America is business.
Smith (2006): The study of politics is the “highest master science” because it incorporates within itself the study of ethics.

#### IMPORTANCE OF:
Aristotle’s answer: 1) only by living in a polis do we fully realize our nature as human beings; only in political life can we utilize our potential (polis is prior to individual) 2) political deliberation is necessary to virtue.
The political partnership must be regarded for the sake of noble acts performed well. Wealth, property exists for the sake of virtue, not virtue for the sake of wealth.
Man is a political animal: best suited to cultivate his excellence in a polis; speech and reason gives us some kind of freedom, not instinct that makes us political. Man is essentially rational, meaning that his faculty of reason is what is most truly his own. Thus if a man allows himself to be ruled only by his faculty of reason, then he is totally free. He simultaneously rules (his reason determines what he should do) and is ruled (he obeys the dictates of his reason)
Aristotle considers it to be a characteristic of man that he alone has any sense of good and evil, of just and unjust.
Exercise of reason leads us to politics: Aristotle believes that humans do everything for a reason, he believes that nature must do everything for a reason as well. This in turn suggests to him that nature has made human rational for a reason; he thus concludes that man is essentially a rational animal and that the exercise of reason is his highest function; speech makes us want to engage in politics… politics is about conflict and conflicts over justice. To be a political animal, for him, is to engage or to be engaged in this ongoing conversation and debate over the very nature of justice, to refuse to participate in that conversation, to declare oneself an outsider to it, he says, is either to be below humanity or above it.
Difference between polis and household: 1) Both exists by nature: the functions generated by the family are incapable of being fulfilled by the family, hence political society arises to complete them. 2) Human beings are nature political animals, so a household can never fulfill that need, and a household would always be an intermediate stage; because of speech we are political animals 3) The polis is prior to the individual and pre-political associations in the order of final causality, the most basic cause of nature. They are related as the part to the whole, and the part cannot function without the whole.
That is it.
