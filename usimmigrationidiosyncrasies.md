How America’s system of immigration is broken and why it needs to be fixed

**History shows that immigration is the lifeblood of America and immigrants reinvigorate the US economy. And therefore they should not be taken for granted. Unfortunately, Americans today appreciate immigrants as most people appreciate health: only when it is gone. There is an old saying by Winston Churchill that the United States can always be counted on doing the right thing after it has exhausted all its other options.**

**However, a faster, globalized world may not allow the US to experiment for long. The immigration system needs to be reformed. Quotas need to rise. Unnecessary rules strapped. The system needs to be simplified. In other words, Americans need to recognize the value of immigrants and Washington needs to act on it. The country has been attracting immigrants from all corners of the world for centuries. But more needs to happen that will let them stay here, even if it is just temporary.**

### **_1. The U.S. Is A Nation Of Immigrations_**

US Consensus, 2010 data shows that to be Americans means to be from everywhere

Virtually all Americans are immigrants or descendants of immigrants. It is true that immigrants have historically not always been welcomed with open hands. In fact, there have been times when immigrants were cast out and accused of stealing American jobs. It is a popular narrative to blame immigrants when times are tough. For example, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Gentlemen’s Agreement of 1907 served as policies to restrict the inflow of new immigrants. The Know Nothing movement of the 1850s sought to purify American politics by restricting immigration.

In the long-term, however, immigrants, who are rather resilient, learned to overcome those obstacles. And slowly but steadily the number of immigrants increased. Today, it is easy for Americans to forget that they are a nation of immigrants. But it is quite true.

### **_2. Immigrants Are One Of The Keys To America’s Success_**

Most immigrants contribute enormously to the lifeblood of American capitalism. Just a look at the list of Fortune 500 companies reveals how many of America’s greatest companies have been co-founded by 1st or 2ndgeneration immigrants. Think of Apple, Google, IBM, eBay, GE or Coca-Cola. Steve Jobs’s father was born in Syria. Google has been co-founded by Sergey Brin and eBay by Pierre Omidyar, both 1st generation immigrants. Hamdi Ulukaya, founder of Chobani, is of Kurdish descent.

Elon Musk set out to solve the world’s biggest challenges upon graduation: the Internet, clean tech and space. He moved on to co-found three companies: PayPal, Tesla and SpaceX. And he was born outside the United States, in Pretoria, South Africa to a Canadian mother. Immigration, therefore, remains a fundamental driver of economic growth and innovation. And the impact that immigrants have is enormous. Their companies create millions of jobs. They turn over trillions of dollars in revenue. Of all US companies, 1st or 2ndgeneration immigrants have founded over 40% of them. And these companies now employ over 10M people and account for 30% of US GDP.

### **_3. More Supply Than Demand_**

There is a wide gap between Real GDP and H-1B Visas Issued, according to US Bureau of Economic Analysis

Since 1999 the US economy grew in real terms by about a quarter. Meanwhile the cap for H1-B working visa and Green cards has been capped for many years, while issuances of F-1 student visas. As the government issues about 500K F-1 visas every year, it restricts H-1B visas to 85K. That meant that last year quota ran out within days. Additionally, there are more than a million people waiting in line for legal permanent residence status. The Kauffmann foundation estimates that more than half a million skilled immigrants wait for legal permanent employment status. According to the OECD the ratio of temporary workers to permanent immigrants is rather low compared to other countries. And high-skilled immigrants only account for 3% of the US workforce.

### **_4. Global Competition For Talent On The Rise_**

China is clearly catching up…

At the same time there is a global shift in economic power, which increases competition for talent around the world. Negative repercussions of a complex, overburdening immigration system should therefore not be underestimated. As immigrants begin to have more choices, competition is set to rise among nation-states for the best and brightest. Thirty years ago immigrants had no real desire to return to their home country, but students today from India and China now think about returning twice. Why should an immigrant put himself or herself through all the troubles when there are so many other options?

They come here to study, but only few can stay to work.

Although American universities attract hundreds of thousands of foreign-born students, there is no simple system in place for these students to seek temporary visas upon graduation. They can apply for work authorization, but the visa only lasts one year. Long-term solutions such as the H1-B are much harder to obtain. The requirements are also more stringent. One has to have a bachelor’s degree, be a skilled worker, work in what is defined as a “specialty occupation”, and leave the country if one loses the job. Meanwhile, other countries issue seven times as many visas that grant permanent residence. It cannot serve the country well to invite young people to study but then make it difficult for them to stay. At the same time, American companies relocate workers abroad as they cannot sponsor immigrants at home.
