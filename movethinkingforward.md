“We have it in our power to begin the world over again.”  
- Thomas Paine, philosopher, revolutionary and founding father

This is the third letter that I have been sending out to my friends and readers. I have been thinking a lot about the purpose of these letters. The initial purpose of this letter was to send a monthly reading recommendation email that featured some of the best reading that I have come across. I figured with so much information out there, anyone can feel inundated with that kind of wealth of information. Where is the right kind of information that I need? What do I google? Who do I follow? Who can I trust? I always appreciated when people that I trusted suggested readings, or recommended books that they have read. Not surprisingly, some of my favorite people in history are authors, those that have taken pen to paper, to help me move my thinking forward.

The purpose of these letters is to establish a two-way feedback loop between thinking and action that involves me and all my readers, or however you’d like to be called. This series of letters is therefore an experiment. I am open to suggestions. I thought once a month could be a good interval between letters, without disrupting your life too much. As an extension of whatever I post on Facebook and Twitter, you can always communicate with me there or by email.

I figured that I want something that is more engaging than a readership. In the newspaper, the editorial team allows its readers to publish comments. In online outlets, this feature exists instantly, often without approval of the moderator. As a reader, I don’t find this comment functionality very engaging. It always seems like the person who is making the post is the authoritative figure in the conversation. I didn’t want to set it up that way.

As I look to the world today, I do not see any single new country that is experimenting politically in the way that the United States has at its inception. However, what I see is technology taking that place with young people all over the world tinkering and experimenting with new ideas. New products and services that they are offering to the world, that makes life in some small way better. To see this happening on such a large scale all over the world is extraordinary. It carries the same seed of potential that the United States carried when it was founded.

During the American Revolution, founding father Thomas Paine wrote a pamphlet called Common Sense. It was a short book written in a simple language that catalyzed independence against the British Crown. In a simple language, Paine explained why colonists should fight for independence. In this way, it inspired colonists to expand their world, depart from British rule, and begin a new world.

Today we live in a similar world. The world is changing rapidly. Technology is expanding exponentially. Changes are happening faster than they ever have in history. This change brings many opportunities and risks. Many people are afraid of technology, others are not sure of their purpose, or how they can contribute. I felt like this in the past.

In the world of technology that we live in today, during times when machines are taking over in every quantitative way impossible, our only competitive advantage in the long-term as humans is creativity. Despite its enormous benefits technology can also be incredibly distracting. It can help us think better, but it can also help us think less.

Throughout my life I have been a prisoner of my thoughts, or rather my thinking. Whenever I escaped from my previous prison, I would enter a new prison. Whenever I learned something new that shifted my own paradigm, there were other things that I didn’t understand. But whenever I felt stuck, I also found new ways to prison break and grow and become stronger as a result. I had to learn again to think better, to think in a more structured way. To think outside the box, whatever you want to call it.

I hope that we will talk over the coming months of how to move thinking forward in this more interactive way. I would love to hear from you, what you think about this, how you think about this. What do you find exciting about this? What do you think is missing? Anything that you feel can move this conversation forward. In the months to come, I hope to create an exchange with you at the intersection of thought and action. I invite you to offer feedback, and ask questions. Hopefully together we can move our lives forward.
