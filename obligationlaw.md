_This is an essay from my undergraduate years at the London School of Economics. I thought maybe someone could use it, in whatever way. Beware academic language._

This essay will argue that there is an obligation to obey the law but it is limited. It is limited in two ways. First, it is limited because there is not one principle or theory, which can create meaningful political obligation. Therefore, I will take Wolff’s multi-principle approach to argue that we need to consider multiple theories of political obligation to legitimize authority and create meaningful obligation for its citizen. In detail, I will focus on the theories of consent, fair play, and membership. Second, the obligation is limited because not every law can be considered just. St. Augustine wrote that an unjust law is no law at all. Henry Thoreau refers to civil disobedience as a means to disobey laws that cannot be considered just. In the end not every obligation is equally weighted, and we cannot have an obligation that applies universally to all.

The theory of consent creates an intuitively powerful obligation for its citizen. Hobbes argued that by leaving the state of nature, we are surrendering our personal judgment to an absolute sovereign, and Hobbes justified the authority of the state by showing that the benefits of the state of absolute authority were greater than the costs of going back to the state of nature. Locke also argued along those lines, although his assumptions about the state of nature differed. He emphasized on tacit consent as a means to make obligation legitimate.

For example, even though a person may not have given express consent, such as a foreign citizen who is being naturalized as a citizen in a new country, by using the government’s highway or not deciding to leave the state of authority, a citizen accepts the government and is then required to obey by the law. There is one important objection, which we need to consider against the theory of consent and that is whether a citizen may actually leave the state of nature when he decides to, and whether a citizen has meaningful choices.

Hume alluded to the example of the sailor, who is given the choice of leaving the boat in the middle of the ocean. Clearly that is not a good example of giving the sailor a meaningful choice. Therefore, against the backdrop of this objection we need to look for further theories of political obligation.

The theory of fairplay creates another link by which an obligation to obey the law is created. The basic assumption of the argument is rather straightforward. Hart was among the first philosophers to propose this view, which creates political obligation. Rawls, who advocated that we have an obligation to obey by institutions that are just and fair, further supported it.

The basic premise is the following: in any given society, whenever there is a system by which citizen mutually benefit, citizen are bound to respect the laws because if everybody would be attempting to freeride, then the system would cease to work. Therefore, in an example given in a neighborhood, in which on each day one neighbor is asked to provide a service to the neighborhood on one day of the year, it would be considered unfair for one person to opt-out, while that person is using the other people’s services at the same time. However, there is an objection by Nozick, which we have to consider.

Nozick argues that it might be true that it is unfair that this person is freeriding, but what if that person did not choose to participate in that scheme in the first place? Surely we need to consider obligation beyond something that simply confers benefits. If we have not asked for those benefits in the first place, why would we be obliged to pay the price? Against this, we can see that while the theory of fairplay might have some advantages, it cannot suffice to have this theory as the sole theory to create political obligation.

The theory of membership has been advocated by Dworkin and creates a link of obligation by asserting that what matters is not that we have consented to that government, or being conferred a benefit upon us, but instead that we are part of a political community. The obligation that is then created is similar to that of a child to their parents. The child has not chosen its parents, but regardless we could argue that there is an obligation that this child will feel towards their parents.

Therefore, the theory of membership is grounded on a feeling of belonging. This seems intuitively powerful, yet against this we need to consider the following objection. For example, lets consider two people, one being born in the US in Texas, close to the border of Mexico, and the other in Mexico, close to the US border. One person is a member of the US, and the other a member of Mexico.

However, this membership is a constructed one, because as the border that is seperating the US from Mexico is a historical accident. Because no one chooses where they were born, it is hard to see how this directly obliges people to obey by the law. As we can see, it is inherently difficult to find one principle by which we can universally apply all citizens to obey by. A multi-principle approach seems more reasonable to legitimize the government, and to create an obligation for citizen to obey by the law.

In the last part of the essay, I want to discuss whether people have an obligation to obey the law that is inherently unjust. Henry Thoreau’s essay on Civil Disobedience had many disciples such as Ghandi and Martin Luther King, and there are numerous historical examples, which show that minorities were being unfairly treated and this unfair treatment was embedded within the legal sytem.

One prominent example were the Jim Crow Laws at the beginning of the 20th century in the United States. Surely one can argue that citizens, who were in that minority, had a duty to resist, a duty for civil disobedience. This might not mean that this minority has a general duty to resist any law. For example, laws pertaining to traffic regulation should still be obeyed. However, there is a duty to resist pertaining to those laws that suppress that very minority. So this example shows that an obligation cannot be a universal obligation for all people. It depends on the circumstance, and the group of people within society.

I have shown in this essay, that if we use Wolff’s multi-principle approach, we can get a meaningful obligation to obey the law as citizens. I have also shown that not one single principle can suffice to legitimize government, as there are plenty of objections for each. I have further used the example of civil obedience to show that obligation cannot be universally applied across society for its entire people. Therefore, there cannot be a single answer to the question.
