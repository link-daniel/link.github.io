When I first moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, I was invited by Danielle Strachman, back then she was leading the Thiel Foundation and now co-founder of the awesome 1517 venture capital fund. I was in awe of the many young entrepreneurs coming together in a community to share knowledge, resources and access to opportunities. Inspired by Benjamin Franklin and perhaps trying to impress Elon Musk, I created Junto, which loosely represented my network at the time.

Its mission was governed by Benjamin Franklin’s original vision of Junto. He nurtured his network to re-align incentives of different stakeholders in order to co-develop ventures such as libraries and co-fund expeditions. It indirectly helped to accelerate the advent of the American Revolution. Well maybe that’s a bit of a stretch, but it definitely positioned Franklin to be very networked in his future environments.

Junto slowly grew into a collection of crypto enthusiasts that shared knowledge, insights, and opportunities with each other. I organized events, gatherings, connected with leaders and built a network where every node could help accelerate each other’s mission. I never sought funding for Junto to build a company and sought to build a community instead. Diversity of thoughts and perspectives was supposed to provide people with a platform from which they could disagree and receive valuable feedback that they could use to improve their startup.

At the end the project failed because I did not properly understand how incentives work. I made the wrong assumptions about people and did not expect the pursuit of self-interest that is so integral in a capitalistic society. It is interesting to see some of these projects go on to raise millions and not give anything back to the community. Crypto is capitalism + community. In the rush of rising asset prices, we shouldn’t forget that and not merely use community as a means to an end to further our own agenda.

I want to thank everyone who participated in this project. By connecting entrepreneurs to the community, Junto has been able to indirectly support numerous projects, albeit in small ways, but connections have been formed and may provide value to the respective nodes in the future.

Junto will operate as an extension and integral part of the network that I’ve built. While Junto has failed, the people that are part of the community are still alive and doing some interesting work in the crypto space. While the project will stay alive in some form, I am no longer am able to actively work on it at the exclusion of everything else.

And here is a lesson from all of this. Never do a venture with your own capital. Align incentives of early stakeholders according to crypto-economic principles. Do not make wrong assumptions about human nature. Cut your losses, which is really hard if you are operating a community of people. But bad actors will ruin the party for everyone else if you let them.

Most importantly and you will sense this if you watch part of this video (here’s the link: [https://youtu.be/sKlpWX6_9pA](https://youtu.be/sKlpWX6_9pA)) originally intended as marketing material is the necessity of clarity of purpose for your venture. Watch the lack of clarity in my speech. Given all the other risks that exists if you do a startup, if the captain is not clear about where the ship is headed, it is likely to sink at the first sign of trouble. An idea that sounds nice in principle is not good enough. You need to be thinking very clearly about what you are setting out to do from the very beginning. Obviously you need to maintain flexibility to change throughout but the intention that you set at the beginning when you start exploring your idea is crucial. Related to that is managing your expectations. If you are not making clear positive decisions, you cannot be fully committed. If you are not fully committed, you cannot execute on your mission. Providence does not move until you are committed. An idea is only as great as your ability to make it happen. Everything else is secondary.
