Hello, World! This is my library from which you can read some of my content.\
<br>
My primary purpose is building a brain computer network to create virtual dreams in order to empower individuals to discover alternative states of mind and by returning to reality break free from infinite loops and realize their dreams. I'm exploring the mind as an undiscovered world and how two-way feedback loops between brains and computers are going to create a frontier of exploration.\
