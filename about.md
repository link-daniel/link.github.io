Hello, World! This is my web home and directory from which you can find things related to my life and work. You may browse through my codex, writings, essays, sketches, notebooks, etc. Some things will be more visible than others.

I'm building Network, a startup dedicated to dream exploration technologies. I'm exploring the mind as an undiscovered world and how two-way feedback loops between brains and computers are going to create a frontier of exploration.
