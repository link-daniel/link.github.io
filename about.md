Hello, World! This is my web home and directory from which you can find things related to my life and work.

I'm building Network, a startup dedicated to dream exploration technologies. I'm exploring the mind as an undiscovered world and how two-way feedback loops between brains and computers are going to create a frontier of exploration.

On this page you can visit my codex, browse through my writings, essays, sketches and notebooks. Some things will be more visible than others.
