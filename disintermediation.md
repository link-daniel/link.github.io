Before Steve Jobs revolutionized the mobile phone industry, he disrupted personal computers, animated movies and the music industry by introducing new insights. As an outsider to the industry, he used disintermediation to standardize and simplify. Disintermediation is defined as “the reduction in the use of intermediaries between producers and consumers.”

As we progress forward in the digital age, this technique will disrupt standard industry and provide fruitful opportunities by focusing its attention on disintegrating businesses, instead. Though disintermediation has a natural limit, many industries haven’t reached that point yet. This piece examines the transformation of three different industries through disintermediation.

**Roads Without Cars**

While innovation in the digital world is spectacular, the same can’t be said for the physical world. For example, various improvements have been made to safety and other products within transportation industry, but nothing can compare to paradigm shifts such as when automobiles replaced horses.

As Henry Ford famously remarked, “If I had asked ask people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses”; instead, Ford provided us with automobiles, something entirely different. Imagine a world where no one owned vehicles and the only means of travel was a shared transportation system such as the Hyperloop, a cheaper, quicker and more secure system as that envisioned by Elon Musk. It would be a transportation system that still retains the individuality of a car but also leverage the economies of scale of a shared system. It would compose thousands of driverless capsules that would take the individual anywhere it wishes to go from work to the grocery store to the movie theatre. The world would be transformed into a driverless, carless, and traffic less society with no road hazards or accidents; everything would abide by perfectly synchronized algorithms. .

**Schools Without Teachers**

Despite the increase of distance education in universities, technology still hasn’t been applied on significantly improving educational methods. Unfortunately, the archaic method of physically attending classrooms and organizing students as per the education system devised in the Industrial Age, is still being used today.

A new model of education would be schools without teachers, but rather one that incentivizes and students to learn on their own at their own pace via digital means. This new classroom would provide the best teachers and resources available for everyone to pursue their studies. Knowledge would no longer be limited by walls and or tuition costs, but rather it would expand to reach audiences of all ages in all parts of the world. It would be a future in which children in Ghana or California would be exposed to the same high-quality teaching material and receive the same level of education. Massive online open courses are a first step, but they cannot be a permanent solution. Though online and distance education centers such as Khan Academy and the Thiel Fellowship provide a provoking alternative to the status quo, we need more to progress forward.

**News Without Stories**

In an increasingly complex world, understanding what is happening around the globe is difficult. People often lack the background and expertise to understand the relationships between events. It is possible to have journalism without individual stories using a form of social media that contains a constant stream of news, such as Twitter, that would present global news in a more curated and individualized method. Each person would have their own concierge, providing them with personalized news on topics of specific interest, in the same way that news are given to presidents on a specific situation. Today, papers such as _Quartz_ or _The New York Times_ deliver a daily brief of such, but this is only the beginning to what is possible.
