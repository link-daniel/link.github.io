At this year’s Confluence, hosted by Infosys, at the Hilton Union Square in San Francisco, Hugh Herr, American rock climber, engineer, and biophysicist, shared his stories of how he was able to turn permanent disadvantage into permanent advantage. It was a deeply inspiring lecture, and I wanted to share some of my notes from that day.

Herr leads the Biomechatronics research group at the MIT Media Lab, where his team is creating bionic limbs that emulate the function of natural limbs. TIME magazine called him the “Leader of the Bionic Age.”

Herr designs body parts that help marry human physiology with electromechanics. After becoming a double amputee himself at an early due to frostbite when he was climbing, Herr decided not let his disadvantage mark the rest of his life in a negative way. Not only did he turn that disadvantage into an advantage, by developing breakthrough advances in bionic limps he has giving other people with physical disabilities mobility and hope.

“Be as you imagine,” he began his lecture, and only by understanding his background can we fully grasp the meaning of these four words. He has made it his life mission to enable profound human augmentation. Herr is hacking nature to an extent that leaves everyone else inspired.

“In 50 years we will eliminate disabilities,” he said. It is remarkable to think that millions of people with all kinds of disabilities will be able to augment themselves to a degree where they no longer feel depressed.

> “The artificial part of my body is beyond immortal — it’s improving with time.” — Hugh Herr

The implications of this go beyond physical disabilities. There are hundreds of other groups of people that suffer from their own kind of disability. Think about bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. This is such an encouraging thought that as we march into this century that we have the opportunity to eliminate so many human sufferings that result from disabilities that are permanent today.

This means that in the future we can design human identity. When society thought that Herr and others were crippled, he looked at the same situation in a different way. When society made certain assumptions that wouldn’t change, Herr challenged those assumptions.

Some of us are born to be different. No longer do those who were born or made different have to be slaves to the identity that society gives them. You can create your own identity, the identity that you imagine.

Think about anything that disables you, whether it is physical or psychological, or anything else and try to find ways around it like Hugh Herr. Build a future based on what you imagine and not what society tells you can or cannot do.
