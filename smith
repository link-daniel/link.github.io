_This is an essay from my undergraduate years at the London School of Economics. I thought maybe someone could use it, in whatever way. Beware academic language._

What is original? According to the _Oxford Dictionary_ it is something that is not dependent on other people’s ideas, inventive or novel.[[1]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn1) In order to determine what elements can be considered original in Adam Smith’s political economy, Smith’s sources of influence must be examined. In his Principia, Newton claimed that if he has been able to see further, it was only because he stood on the shoulders of giants.[[2]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn2)

In that regard, we have to analyze the content of _The Wealth of Nations_, from which Smith’s political economy is derived, accordingly and understand that there are two elements to Smith’s political economy. Adam Smith’s originality needs to be understood against the background of the thinkers and people that Smith over a lifetime has been influenced by. These include, amongst others, Locke, Hume, Hutcheson, Turgot and Quesnay. What perhaps then made Smith’s thought original was not the fact that he brought all the ingredients to the table, but rather that he added the missing ingredient and was able to connect the dots. Today, Smith is known as the father of modern economics, and his reputation comes from his ability to explain how self-interest in a free market economy can lead to a greater economic good. Thus, the purpose of this essay is two-fold: First, and before I present what exactly made Smith’s political economy original, I want to credit all the ones that have influenced Smith and made it possible for him to stand on the shoulders of giants as Newton would say. Then in the substantive part of the essay I will focus on the key concepts of political economy such as free trade, self-interest, and the invisible hand as well as the role of government in the economy and his argument against mercantilism and how Smith’s account of political economy still retains originality. By presenting both the ones that have influenced Smith, and the influence that Smith has had since publication _The Wealth of Nations_ in 1776, I hope to present a clear statement of what made Adam Smith’s political economy original.

Many thinkers influenced Adam Smith, and while this may not diminish the originality of his political economy, it is important to acknowledge these people that had a profound impact on the way Smith was thinking. The natural law, through thinkers such as Grotius, had a strong influence on Smith. What Viner identifies as even more powerful influences was the Renaissance emphasis on the individual, the naturalistic philosophy of Shaftesbury, Locke, Hume, Hutcheson, the optimistic theism of the Scotch philosophers, and the empiricism of Montesquieu. [[3]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn3) Hume’s _Political Discourses on Money and Trade_ will most likely have influenced him in consolidating his stance against mercantilism. Cantillon is one of the few economists cited by Adam Smith, who directly borrows Cantillon’s sustenance theory of wages.[[4]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn4)

Phillipson emphasizes that Smith was able to develop and define his general economic theory in his last year at Glasgow, and in France in the company of Quesnay and the economistes.[[5]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn5) In fact, it was Smith’s intention to dedicate _The Wealth of Nations_ to Quesnay, but he had unfortunately died before its publication. Quesnay had been influencing while Smith was in Paris. Rothschild agrees when she writes that both Hume and Smith had been considered in Scotland by French scepticism. Further, libertarian and early economic concepts such as freedom of internal trade or freedom of foreign had been part of the public discourse. Viner explains how Hutcheson had already skteched out the concept of an underlying natural order manifesting itself through the physical forces and individual psychology. [[6]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn6) What he learned from Hutcheson about the love of liberty, he did not learn from him that self-interest works for the benefit of society. Cannon acknowledges Mandeville, who first made Smith realize that it is not from the benevolence of the people that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. [[7]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn7) In regards to Smith’s critical stance towards established church, Voltaire’s Candide could have easily been his influential source. However not all of the thinkers that he was influenced by he agreed entirely with. This shapes part of his original thought. Rothschild illustrates that, even though Burke and Smith were on friendly terms, they had their differences. While Smith regarded monopolies as a wretched derangement of natural order, for Burke the monopoly of capital is a great benefit, and benefit particularly to the poor. [[8]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn8) Rothshild writes how Smith’s call to limit the great incorporation of the established church, and to promote science as an antidote of enthusiasm and superstitition, is some of his boldest statement in his book. [[9]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn9) Smith also criticized Hutcheson, who believed that self-love could never be seen as a virtue. But we must also not forget, that _The Wealth of Nations_ was composed over a span of over twenty-five years, and while Smith certainly was influenced by many different sources. As Cannon suggests, to attempt to apportion the merit between different authors is like standing on some beach and discussing whether this or that particular wave had most to do with the rising tide.[[10]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn10) Nevertheless it is clear that the sources by which Smith had been influenced flowed directly into The Wealth of Nations. Schumpeter argues that no matter what he actually learned or failed to learn from predecessors, the fact is that the Wealth of Nations does not contain a single analytic idea, principle, or method that was entirely new in 1776. [[11]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn11) Despite the fact that there may not be any new idea, principle or method with Smith’s publication in 1776, the second part of the essay will shed some light on what elements in Smith’s political economy can be considered original.

If so many different thinkers have widely and extensively influenced Smith, what can there be left in terms of originality in his political economy? Well, going back to his earlier work we can recognize that Smith’s political economy cannot be recognized without reading _A Theory of Moral Sentiment._ Viner writes that in his _Theory of Moral Sentiments_, Smith develops his system of ethics on the basis of a harmonious order in nature guided by God, and in an incidental manner applies his general doctrine with strict consistency to the economic order. [[12]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn12) We should not forget that Smith was a professor of moral philosophy, and his economic theory emerged as a byproduct of that. Rogger describes Smith as the true spectator of the human scene, involved in that scene, but always capable of detached analysis and appraisal of everything that came within his view. [[13]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn13) Another key to originality lies in Smith’s drive to change society by public consent. Rothschild states that to respect public opinion was of central importance to Smith’s political philosophy. [[14]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn14) Rosenberg characterized _The Wealth of Nations_ as a systematic critique of human institutions, describing the ill effects of institutions on commerce. Smith had very different views on what constituted wealth. Conventional wisdom suggested that wealth lay in gold and silver. For Smith it was the ‘annual produce of land and labor of the society.’[[15]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn15) While under the mercantilist view, large hoarding of gold and silver was considered as a good policy, Smith recognized that wealth does not reside in money because it is just a medium of exchange. His analysis concluded that specialization and productivity creates bigger output, and the process of the division of labor decreases prizes and makes goods more affordable for even the poorest people. What makes his economic theory original is the mutual desire to trade that arises out of specialization. For Smith, self-interest does not necessarily equal selfishness, because he realized that people would not just give us things that we desire for nothing. He writes that “he tends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.” What Smith refers to, as the Invisible Hand, can be considered somewhat original. This includes the whole notion of trading not out of benevolence, but benefit coupled with the concepts of division of labor and specialization. His clear and crisp explanation of supply and demand in a market economy, in which natural price and market price converge, deserves recognition. Rothschild notes that Smith believed, as did Turgot and Condorect, that freedom was much less cruel for the poor than the policies of oppressive and ill-informed government. [[16]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn16) Viner equals Smith to a system-builder, in which economic phenomena as manifestations of an underlying order in nature governed by natural forces gave to English economics for the first time a definite trend toward logically consistent synthesis of economic relationships. [[17]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn17) Smith was capable of connecting the dots by encompassing all previous knowledge into his theory that within a natural order individuals and countries could trade harmoniously and beneficially. He applied many liberal ideas into his economic theory, yet he did not fully embrace laissez faire. He was ready to give governments more responsibility but was also well aware of all the harm that was caused by government policies, and the benefits of freedom of interference. Friedman notes that his overall vision is important when assessing his political economy, in particular, the concept that without any central body planning it, millions of people could coordinate their activities in ways that was mutually beneficial to all of them. [[18]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn18) Viner concludes that Smith made an original forward step when he seriously applied himself to the task of analyzing the whole range of economic process with the purpose of discovering the nature of the order, which underlay its surface chaos. [[19]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn19) Another original key in his political economy is the concept of accumulation of capital. Smith believed that a virtuous cycle was created by which growth of capital promotes specialization and this creates surplus. This surplus can be reinvested into new equipment, which makes even more specialization and growth possible. This cycle is completely different from the mercantilist view, which suggests that the world is basically a zero-sum game. Next, his insistence that saving and not spending matters was revolutionary. Butler writes how under the mercantilist view dis-saving does not matter if the spending is done domestically. [[20]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn20) Yet Smith showed that the future income depends on the extent of our capital and the only way to accumulate capital is by saving. To determine what is really original in his political economy, in the end, can only be determined by the way we look at it. Cannan notes that we need not suppose that someone else would not soon have given it its place in English economics if Adam Smith had not done so, but that need not deter us from recording the fact that it was he who introduced it. Smith was not a thinker void of peculiarities and prejudices, but his heart was at the right place. He wished to promote the interest not only of the powerful and rich, but also of the masses, in general and the poor, in particular. He did not put much faith in government, and was convinced that the less the better, but also recognized that there were some functions that could not be done by anyone but government t the government. But he did not believe in the free markets entirely and given the many examples that Smith gives it really depends on the circumstances. Regulation itself is not bad. It just depends on the circumstances. Perhaps this is what makes Smith’s political economy original then, the many bits and pieces that Smith was able to put together and assemble into a clear and coherent economic theory that is build on common sense. But as Voltaire said, common sense is not so common.

I have shown in this essay that there are two elements in assessing the originality of Smith’s political economy, and in particular what is original about it. I have identified key thinkers that have influenced Smith in many ways to show that what even what remains original in his political economy is build on previous work by other thinkers, and that whenever we acknowledge Smith’s originality in regards to his political economy, we need to admit that without the people that had an influence on Smith there could not have been his seminal work that was published in 1776. By having highlighted what is not original about Smith’s political economy, it has been then much easier in the second part to recognize the key concepts, which distinguish his political economy from others. Smith’s political economy may not fit the definition of original by the dictionary in the sense that he invented something entirely new. Thus, what makes Smith’s political economy original is not that he created all the ideas from which he build on but rather that he put them all together into an economic theory that would give birth to the discipline of economics.
