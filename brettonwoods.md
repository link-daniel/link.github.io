_This is an essay from my undergraduate years at the London School of Economics. I thought maybe someone could use it, in whatever way. Beware academic language._

This essay will defend the hypothesis that the Bretton Woods system was a hegemonic system that emerged out of WWII, which became unsustainable due to its incompatibility issues and the inability to deal with the growing changes of the world economy. The purpose of this essay is then two-fold. First, I will illustrate the U.S. dominance that was embedded within the Bretton Woods system, and second, I will make two points on how the Bretton Woods system broke down. I will use the Mundell-Fleming Trilemma, the Triffin Dilemma, and an argument of international capital flows to show that the Bretton Woods system was bound to break down eventually, and in fact its demise was only delayed because the U.S. was controlling it.

In the first part of the essay, I want to demonstrate that the Bretton Woods system was dominated by one country, worked in favor of that country, yet not necessarily exclusively in favor of that country but the Bretton Woods system also conferred benefits onto other nations. The U.S. emerged as the most powerful nation after World War II. The economic and military might of the U.S. hegemon was unmatched. The U.S. dollar was the currency with the most purchasing power and the only one backed by gold. Europe was heavily indebted, and relying on the U.S. for support. The U.S. had already imposed their dominance when during the Bretton Woods conference policies presented by American delegate Henry Dexter White were favored to the ones of Britain’s delegate John Maynard Keynes. Keynes argued that the goal was to find a common measure, a common standard, a common rule acceptable to each not irksome to any, but the U.S. disagreed.

Not entirely, but the debate between whether economic growth or economic stability should be at the core of the new monetary order was decided in favor of the U.S. For the U.S. it made all sense. They were replacing the old gold standard with a dollar standard, and since they were holding the largest portion of gold reserves there did not seem to be any other choice but the U.S. to take the lead.

However this dominance, or rather leadership was not all skewed towards the interest of the U.S. For example the Marshall plan is an illustration of a successful byproduct that arose from the Bretton Woods system. Although the Marshall plan had U.S. interest in mind by containing communism and securing a future market, the plan also helped countries such as Germany to experience what is commonly known as an economic miracle.

The long-term commitment of the United States to reconstruct Europe should not be underestimated. In other words, it was natural for the U.S. to assume the leadership position in creating a new monetary order, but this dominance should not necessarily be looked at in only a negative way as there are examples such as the Marshall plan, which also conferred benefits onto other nations.

In the second part of the essay, I will use the Triffin Dilemma to explain why the Bretton Woods system broke down after the Nixon shock in 1971, the event that triggered the break down. According to the Mundell-Fleming Trilemma, a country cannot simultaneously maintain a fixed exchange rate, macroeconomic autonomy, and free flow of capital and so under the Bretton Woods system countries opted for a fixed exchange rate and macroeconomic autonomy at the expense of free flow of capital. [[1]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn1)

Over twenty years later when the U.S. went off the gold standard, countries gave up the fixed exchange rate for a free flow of capital. If we can understand what caused that transition from fixed exchange rate to free flow of capital, the causes of the break down will become apparent. Yale professor Triffin argued that in order to provide liquidity for the rest of the world, the U.S. would have to run trade deficits. [[2]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn2) As the U.S. was injecting liquidity into foreign economies through the Marshall plan the number of dollars began to exceed the amount of gold backing them up, and slowly firms and countries turned away from the dollar and asked themselves whether the U.S. could really back up their currency with gold.

The success of the Bretton Woods system therefore depended upon the stability of economic policy in the United States. As Woods shows, the economic policy in the United States became increasingly unstable after 1965 when they began to spend more money without raising taxes through their military involvement in Vietnam, public education or urban development as part of President Johnson’s Big Society. [[3]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn3) This had the result of U.S. prices rising, making U.S. goods less competitive. So as the U.S. was playing the role of the world’s central banker by exporting dollars, the rest of the world began to grow challenging U.S. trade competitiveness.

The Bretton Woods system then broke down because of its fundamental flaw of pledging convertibility to gold, which was unsustainable given the course of U.S. economic policy. As supply of dollars increased, the likelihood of the U.S. being able to convert the currency back into gold decreased, and this culminated with the Nixon shock when President Nixon decided in August 1971 to suspend convertibility to gold. Besides another demonstration of U.S. dominance was the fact that other countries were asked to revalue their own currency, or else risk trade tariff sanctions. Altogether the Triffin Dilemma can be used a means to explain why the Bretton Woods system eventually broke down.

In the third part of the essay, I will focus on international capital flows and the rise of developing countries by arguing that the Bretton Woods system could not adequately deal with the changes that were happening in the world. The system was not designed to deal with international capital flows as fixed exchange rates placed an emphasis on stability not integration of capital markets and economic growth. If we compare the world in which the Bretton Woods system was born after WWII with the world when it broke down, we can notice distinct differences.

That might be obvious but it is useful to look at the difference closely. After WWII the U.S. was unchallenged in its power, Europe was destroyed and Asia still sleeping. Twenty years later, Europe recovered and began to benefit from early stages of economic integration while in Asia, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan also began to grow. Eichengreen argues that market participants found new and clever ways of circumventing international capital flows. And the recovery of international financial markets and transactions from the disruptions of depression and war had been delayed, but by the 1960s it was well under way. [[4]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn4) Thus, economic power over time became much more dispersed than it was immediately after WWII, so naturally this requires a monetary system, which incorporates different actors and not a monetary system, which is largely controlled by the hegemon.

As Soros argues, the Bretton Woods institutions, the IMF and the World Bank, were designed to facilitate international trade and investment in an environment of restricted private capital flows. [[5]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn5) However as the environment began to change and capital controls were slowly removed, the Bretton Woods system was no longer adequate. In order to integrate new developing countries, a new monetary system was needed that was not tied and controlled by one country but instead incorporated many different actors. Therefore, the Bretton Woods system was never designed for a world in which capital flows were becoming increasingly international and the world truly global. It was due to this lack of design that made it break down eventually.

I have argued that the Bretton Woods system was a U.S. dominated system yet it also had ripple effects in both positive and negative ways. I have elaborated on the break down of the Bretton Woods system in two points. I used the Triffin Dilemma to show that the Bretton Woods system was not only dependent upon the economic policies of the U.S. but there was also an inherent incompatibility issue between a fixed exchange regime and increasing international capital flows.

Two world wars and the Great Depression interrupted the first era of globalization, and the Bretton Woods system marked a temporary period to recover from those events. In the first decade of the 21st century, we have witnessed a global financial crisis, so it is paramount to keep the lessons of the Bretton Woods system in mind.
