This is a brief on Thomas Hobbes and The Leviathan that I prepared for my exam on political philosophy at the London School of Economics. May it help you in whatever way you need to prepare for Hobbes. It’s not complete, but covers most areas. It covers Hobbes on topics of the state of nature, political obligation, absolute sovereignty, conflict between individual liberty and absolute sovereignty, sovereignty by institution and conquest.

“Critiques Of” includes philosophers or ideas that challenge the topic. “Importance Of” explains the most important points on the topic from the philosopher’s point of view. And “Excerpts Of”, as the name suggests, offers a few quotes by the philosopher.

### I STATE OF NATURE

#### CRITIQUES OF:
Szelenyi (2009): Emphasis on peace and order, not on abuse of power.

Aristotle: Natural vs. Artificial society

Williams (2010): When we act, we may do so selfishly, impulsively or in ignorance, on the basis of faulty reasoning or bad theology or other’s emotive speech.

Taylor: Minimal morality

A world of unrestricted liberty is a disaster

Smith (2006): The state of war is undesirable and ordered society desirable. Disorder is due to man’s natural desire for power, his ambition or pride. Organized society is due to man’s desire for security, his fear of death. The book is based on a biblical metaphor about overcoming or subduing pride. Hobbes wants us to see the dangers of pride and the advantages of peace.

Smith (2006): If one were to follow Hobbes’s risk averse psychology, if one were to follow the 19 laws of nature that advise us to seek peace and to avoid conflict, why would ever one become a fireman, a soldier, a risk taker?

The only way to escape the state of war is to form a commonwealth, either by agreement or force of arms, and then to have in that commonwealth an absolute sovereign claiming virtually absolute obedience.

Warrender: God will punish us if we do not act in accordance with the law of nature

D.D. Raphael: It is the laws of nature that tell us to keep in existence an organized state and to give to that state complete obedience. A study of the laws of nature is a study of causal connections between human nature and civil society.

MacPherson: Hobbes is a product of his time, and his pessimism is not necessarily reflective of mankind in general.

#### IMPORTANCE OF:
Human nature: always searching for more pleasure — never at rest; man as a machine and rejects the teachings of Aristotle; concepts of physics applied to political theory; no one is invulnerable nor can expect to be able to dominate the others; people shun death and desire peace; individualistic.
Absence of morality: power instead of morality; subjective right to stay alive

Lack of impartial judge: human’s judgment is biased; everyone will act on her judgments as they think best; each is under no obligation to help or assist any person

Historical precedent: all sovereigns are in this state with respect to one another; many civilized people were formally in that state; states which have collapsed into civil war

The right of nature: to do whatever one sincerely judges needful for one’s preservation. This right invites serious conflict, esp. if there is competition for scarce resources which will quite naturally lead people to fear that others may invade them, and this will lead them to rationally plan to strike first as an anticipatory defense.

The 6 conditions: egoism (individualistic), scarcity (competition for scarce resources), equality (even the weakest can kill the strongest), competition (violence for gain), diffidence (pre-emptive defensive attacks); glory (violence for reputation). Those six conditions lead to sub-optimal results for society as a whole.

Equals state of war: it is the natural condition, while peace is temporary and insecure; we cannot have peace without society; fueled by disagreements about religious views or moral judgments; we cannot fully be free of the fear of the state of nature even within the civil society

#### LAW OF NATURE IN:
Rational rules for self-preservation: rules which we can reason out as the only way to preserve our lives, the human condition being what it is.
Prescriptive: how people ought to behave; it says that it is rational to seek peace; they express what is best for the individual considering all others do the same; attack is dominant strategy but collectively suboptimal — ascending to collective rationality optimal.

Seek peace when others are willing to do so, preserve yourself, keep agreements

Obligations of natural law are hypothetical imperatives — if you want x do y.

#### EXCERPTS OF:
“Bellum omnium contra omines”

“Life is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short”

“People cannot assure the power and means to live well, which he hath present, without the acquisition of more”

“A restless desire of Power after Power, that ceaseth only in Death”

“For so long as man is in the condition of mere nature, as private appetite is the measure of good and evil”

“Theoretically limited right of nature becomes in practice an unlimited right to potentially anything, a right to all things”

“In such a condition every man has a Right to everything; even to one another’s body”

“To this warre of every man against every man… nothing can be unjust.”

“Each person has the ‘liberty…to use known power…for the preservation of his own Nature; that is to say of his own life; and consequently, of doing anything, which in his Judgment, and Reason, he shall conceive to be the aptest means thereunto”

“The weakest has strength enough to kill the strongest, either by secret machination or by confederacy with others”

#### EXCERPTS OF LAW OF NATURE:
They can be “contracted into one easy sum… Do not that to another, which thou wouldst not have done to thy selfe”

“As farre as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use, all helps, and advantages of Warre”

“Be contented with as much liberty against other men as he would allow other men against himself”

### II POLITICAL OBLIGATION

The Leviathan by Hobbes

#### CRITIQUE OF:
Skinner (1978): Why else would we enter the state except to better preserve our lives?

Kelly (2011): A motive to seek self-preservation and thus will try to do what is necessary for that — in Hobbes’ case that involves setting up the sovereign state.

Kelly: Does prudence give the right kind of obligation? Hobbes seems to leave us in a world without obligations. Prudence seems to provide the wrong kind of answer.

Taylor (1908): The duty to keep promises is a real one.

Warrender (1957): God will punish if do not act in accordance with the law of nature so a real obligation based on higher prudence. What we lack is the motive and that reason gives us access to our genuine obligations.

Law of nature is law of reason; reason leads us to leave the state of nature; reason is an obligation but not adequate as it comes from God, so we need political obligation which is coercive and more binding.

Hampton (1986): Hobbes theory must fall on its own terms.

Hampton: “How can people who are concerned above all else to preserve themselves believe that it is rational to create an absolute master who has the power to decide which of them lives or dies?”

#### IMPORTANCE OF:
Legitimacy by consent: To escape so dreadful a condition, people surrender their independence by entering into a covenant to obey a sovereign power that will have the authority to make, enforce, and interpret laws. The subjects consent to obey those who have effective power over them, whether the subject has a choice in who holds power or not. Because they consent, they therefore have an obligation to obey the sovereign, whether sovereignty be instituted or acquired.

Rationality leads us to enter society, as rational individual can improve his life by choosing sovereign over state of nature; men engage in contracts for stable society, giving up natural rights; reason favors morality seeking peace and stable society

We give up any rights which obstruct peace but not those which are indispensable to us maintaining our lives.

### III ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGNTY

Destruction of Leviathan by Gustave Doré

#### CRITIQUE OF:
Smith (2006): The sovereign can never act unjustly? How can Hobbes justify this? There can be no such thing as an unjust law? A law that is intended simply to constrain and control for its own sake cannot be a good law.

Hobbes was unable to see the rebellion of Parliament against Charles I as part of the general dissolution of the medieval structure of thought and society.

Resemblance of fascists totalitarian philosophy: his notion of an all-powerful judge of definitions, making decisions that cannot be disputed.
Right to disobey sovereign if he goes against the natural rights of subject, conflicts with disobedience to sovereign: men cannot lay down the right to resists those that assault him or threaten wounds, chains and imprisonment. Subjects can use all means necessary, but Hobbes say that there is no liberty to refuse: for it will frustrate the sovereign … if collective, will lead to collapse of civil society.

Condones defiance and continuation of rebellious behavior.

Contradiction between rationality and human psychology: though Hobbes sets out to prove the rationality of instituting an absolute sovereign, his assumption of human psychology (insurmountable fear of death/injury) make this impossible.

Williams (2010): Sovereign cannot defend his commonwealth from internal and external threats; internal = no effective coercive mechanism in place to preserve order; external = allows subjects the right not to fight; when a foreign invader has ousted our government… our allegiance belongs to whoever happens to be holding the guns. Perversely, the only crime the makers of a coup can commit is to fail.

Williams: As soon as government starts to weaken and disorder sets in, our duty of obedience lapses. That is, when the sovereign power needs our support because it is no longer able to coerce us, there is no effective judge or enforcer of covenants, so that such promises no longer override our right of nature.

Hampton (1988): Why would sovereign not be tyrannical? Hobbes does not adequately explain why the sovereign and people cannot be separated. He may engage in disastrous wars, which limited authority would not? Is Leviathan a short-term, glory-seeking Machiavel
Limitation of power leads to civil war is a complete generalization: ignores relevance of social context, historical-political situation; might not concentration of power make war more likely?

Kafka (1986): “Security and order require a sufficient concentration of certain governmental powers of exercise, not a total concentration of the power to select exercisers of unlimited powers.”

Szelenyi (2009): “Apologetic theory of enlightened absolutism.”

Baumgold (2003): “Bodinian proposition that either sovereignty is absolute or there is no state in existence.”

#### IMPORTANCE OF:
To avoid civil war: Moral and political philosophy was to show how to avoid civil war and disorder. The Leviathan was the answer to the threat and reality of civil war.

Unlimited and undivided power: Hobbes is infamous for having used the social contract method to arrive at the astonishing conclusion that we ought to submit to the authority of an absolute — undivided and unlimited — sovereign power. People should contract with one another to entrust the task of judging what is right and wrong to a sovereign on whom very extensive powers are conferred. Only a government that possesses all of what Hobbes terms the essential rights of sovereignty can be reliably effective.

Fear of return to state of nature: To avoid the horrible prospect of governmental collapse and return to the state of nature, people should treat their sovereign as having absolute authority.

Characteristics of Leviathan: artificial product; representative of the people; we make a new body politic and cease to be an aggressor; the sovereign is not party to any contract; impersonal and anonymous; contains both secular absolutism and modern liberalism; his rights include the laws concerning property, right to declare war and peace, and rules concerning life and death.

Reservation of liberty: although the government has absolute power, Hobbes reserves its subjects the liberty of disobeying some of the governments commands. They can disobey when their own lives are endangered or if family is at stake.

Real security only under absolute sovereign acting for all members of confederation: some concentration of authority for external/internal defense necessary; otherwise ‘private sword hath place again.’

Ultimate moral rules cannot be supreme, laws always subject to interpretation: can solve this by appointing a Sovereign (as opposed to judge); need absolute sovereign to define rights

‘Powers divided mutually destroy each other’ because: Greed/glory/defense; division of institutions/values: no higher power to settle disputes; you cannot divide power of commonwealth (imperium summum); covenants without the sword are but words and of no strength to cure a man at all.’

Limited government rejected: if one claims sovereign is in breach, no higher power to play Judge, so back to sword; limited government means giving citizen interpretative power: problematic

#### EXCERPT OF:
“For what it is to divide the power of a commonwealth, but to dissolve it; for powers divided mutually destroy each other.”

### IV CONFLICT BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND ABSOLUTE SOVEREIGNTY

Leviathan by Thomes Hobbes

#### CRITIQUE OF:
Individual liberty cannot be reconciled easily with absolute political authority, as this authority is a function of absolute political obligation of subjects. Hobbes justifies continuing to disobey sovereign. Thus, liberty cannot always be reconciled with absolute sovereignty in the world of Leviathan.
Achilles heel of his theory: concerning Hobbes’s discussion of the limits of political obligation, individual can release himself in order to protect himself — inalienable right, non-transferable. His “true liberties of subjects” seem incompatible with his defense of absolute sovereignty.

The condemned man on the way to execution would not act unjustly resisting those charged with executing him, but no one has the right to help anyone else in such a situation — only self-preservation.

#### CONFLICT OF:
Subjects given liberty to: refuse to obey sovereign’s commands if in their judgment, they pose a threat to their security.

### V SOVEREIGNTY BY INSTITUTION AND CONQUEST

#### CONTRADICTION OF:
Kelly (2011): De jure authority follows de facto power.

There is a contradiction insofar as while in sovereignty by institution the subjects covenant with each other to create a sovereign, while in sovereignty by conquest the subjects do not covenant with each other, but they do directly with the sovereign. That might be the contradiction because the “conquered” people, first, do not have a real choice, since they would have been killed otherwise, and, second, they are not giving the opportunity as in sovereignty by institution to form a social contract between themselves.


#### DISTINCTION OF:
Institution: by explicit covenant or agreement; to escape so dreadful a condition, people surrender their independence by entering into a covenant to obey a sovereign power that will have the authority to make, enforce, and interpret laws.

Conquest: by taking, William the Conqueror; conquerors acquire authority over those they subject to their rule

Fear of each other vs. fear of the sovereign: but both have the same function to protect society and secure peace and both have the same rights relative to their subjects.

#### EXCERPT OF:
“Authorize and give up my Right of Governing my selfe, to this Man, or to this Assembly of men, on this condition, that thou give up thy Right to him, and Authorize all his Actions in like manner.”
