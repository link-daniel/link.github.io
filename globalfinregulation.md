_This is an essay from my undergraduate years at the London School of Economics. I thought maybe someone could use it, in whatever way. Beware academic language._

This essay will defend the hypothesis that the system of global financial regulation represents an example of global governance with limited success. Globalization has produced unparalleled levels of both economic risk and growth, and as a result financial markets have become more open and global finance has grown bigger and more complex while at the same time regulators have been struggling to catch up with those changes.

Unfortunately global governance today is based on ad hoc arrangements with inadequate capacity and coercive power. There is over one major crisis every three years, so clearly there is need for a more comprehensive financial regulatory regime. [[1]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn1) According to the Council on Foreign Relations, there are two major reasons why the current system cannot represent an example of successful global governance. First, there are too many institutions and mechanisms — often with overlapping mandates but limited power and second building critical agreement often proves impossible. [[2]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn2) Thus, if global governance wants to be more successful, the weaknesses that came to light during the global financial crisis need to be properly addressed.

The success of global governance is limited in two ways. The system does not have a single, global regulator, and any attempts by the current system to regulate on a global level have been ad hoc and not substantive. However, the extent to which the current system of global financial regulation is or can become successful depends on the degree to which it can adapt and change to a rapidly changing globalized world. There is consensus on the need for a more stable financial environment in which regulatory reforms can sustain financial stability and prevent systemic risk failures within the global financial system.

First, global governance is restricted due to its practical and political realities and using Blackmore and Jeapes’s five-point analysis, which argues against a global financial regulator, I will show that to answer the _how_ we need to understand that even though global governance cannot be truly global due to its practical and political constraints, we need to look for convergences and areas in which we can find a common ground to create a more cohesive and stronger system of global financial regulation. Second, I will analyze attempts of global governance in the financial sphere through recent developments and argue that _the extent_ to which the current system is or can become successful depends on strong leadership to put into action those areas, in which nation-states converge. In essence, I will argue that global governance within the financial sphere is punching below its weight or potential of what it can do to adapt itself to the growing changes that we are facing in the 21st century.

The first limitation results from practical and political realities that make it difficult for a system of global financial regulation to be truly global. A single, global regulator is simply neither realistic nor feasible under the current power settings of nation-states. Even if nation-states would potentially agree on the necessity to reform, they would still be hindered by their own national interest and the differences to other political regimes. In fact, it is very unlikely in the near term for those state entities willingly to surrender their national sovereignty to a global regulatory body.

We can witness this first hand with the Eurozone debt crisis in which member states cannot even agree, let alone create a common treasury to ease financial woes. On paper it would sound great to have a regulator that can implement and enforce globally harmonized rules. However realistically given that we live in a pluralistic world in which many countries have different conceptions of what makes up good regulation, it is hard to imagine how we would collectively arrive at those globally harmonized rules in the first place. Two examples showcase the conflict of harmonization. While employees in Germany need to have effective, up to fifty percent, representation on the board of directors, such a role does not exist in the UK. While the British pride themselves to have a low minimum capital requirement for public companies, the minimum capital requirement under European Company Regulation is set at 120,000 Euros. [[3]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn3) It seems almost impossible today that with different conceptions of how to regulate, we cannot have one set of regulation across multiple jurisdictions. But perhaps the impossible just takes a little bit longer.

Let us suppose for a moment that the political will existed to create a single, global regulator. Blackmore and Jeapes argue that considering the complexity of the global financial system with its different financial institutions that we live in, the global regulator would probably still be too large and unmanageable. [[4]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn4) They further point to the philosophical, political and historical differences between nations such as the United States, China and the European Union and the fact that financial regulation is inextricably linked with monetary and macro-economic policy as well as to the central banks’ role as lenders of last resort. [[5]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn5) Considering that these are functions that are performed by state bodies, it is unlikely to see them give away power to a global financial regulator. Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, once said that financial institutions, which have been global in life, become national in death, and this demonstrates another issue by which it would be difficult to embed local bankruptcy laws within a system of global financial regulation.

Nonetheless, even if we cannot find a single, global regulator on account of our differences, world leaders should be able to focus on areas in which there is common ground and work from there to create a stronger system of global financial regulation. Kapstein argues that there is a dual mandate of stability and competitiveness and international cooperation is created to realize those joint benefits.[[6]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn6) So this shows that there are areas in which many countries can find a common ground, and we should not render global governance unsuccessful because of the fact that we cannot create a single, global regulator.

The second limitation results from world leaders, who do not act cohesively and in a coordinated manner. Better quality regulatory oversight requires strong and effective ways to coordinate and to exchange information in several key sectors. [[7]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn7) In other words, what we need is strong leadership to make global governance more successful. World leaders have shown during the global financial crisis when providing stimulus and bailout packages to ease financial markets that, if necessary, they are able to come together and work constructively.

However world leaders should try to work on solutions ahead of a crisis, because it is part of successful global governance to look ahead and not simply react to a crisis. Rather than setting out the fire when the house is burning, world leaders should seek ways to prevent the house from burning in the first place, or not letting the fire spread to other houses. Next Simmons argues that the US acts as a global hegemon in financial regulation. [[8]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn8) Yet for global governance to be global it needs to have a proper global representation. At the onset of the global financial crisis, the G20 has become more important than the G8. This is a step in the right direction.

Mallaby reports that the World Bank has successfully increased voting shares for developing and transition countries across its various groups and the quota reallocation at the IMF shifted six percent of quota share to developing economies. [[9]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn9) By embracing the Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth, the G20 has demonstrated in Pittsburgh that it can assume the leadership role in global governance, but in many ways the G20 has not lived up to its high expectations yet. It has not build a robust mechanism by which further crisis can be potentially prevented. It has not addressed the massive structural imbalances that we have in the world. There is not even a consensus between the US and China as to how to rebalance the system. While the US believes that the Chinese are manipulating their currency and should let the Chinese yuan appreciate in value, the Chinese are trying to shift away from dollar reserves. A further problem is the fact that many regulatory bodies that currently exist work on a voluntary compliance basis.

The Basel Committee works based on consensus among its members, and the International Organization of Security Commissions has voluntary compliance. The Financial Stability Board that was created by the G20 does not have much power and could be dismantled by the G20 as quickly as it was brought into life. [[10]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn10) In addition, world leaders have also not addressed the fact that any financial crisis has a disproportionate effect on less developed economies. For global governance to be successful, it needs to take care of all stakeholders in the world and not skew its policies towards industrialized countries.

I have argued that while we may not have a single, global regulator, we can create successful global governance by focusing on areas in which world leaders can find a common ground. If we can work on issues that we can all agree upon, we can do what is necessary to keep the financial system safe and stable. Whether this new regulation will come through the old system or through a new global architecture is not as important as the fact that world leaders should work out long-term solutions rather than deal with issues on an ad hoc basis.

At the World Economic Forum in 2010, Trichet reminded us that the market economy is the best way to create wealth, but we also need to create a global market system that is much more solid. [[11]](https://medium.com/p/new-post#_ftn11) For global governance to be successful, either under the current system or a new one, world leaders need to strike a balance between these two to ensure a more resilient financial system that can cope with the changes of the 21st century.
