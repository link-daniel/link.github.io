### Presence: A Short Film Series

Presence is an original short film series that celebrates the importance of presence, or how to live in the present moment.

I started stitching together old footage from Hong Kong, New York and Cambridge to create three short films to remind myself to stay in the present. Optimized for the internet’s short attention span, each video is only 90 seconds long.

The Hong Kong edition was edited by [RYOT](http://ryot.huffingtonpost.com), while I edited the other two. The score in all editions was composed by [David Grinbaum](http://davidgrinbaum.com/). All the footage was shot on an iPhone 5.

#### You need to stay present. If you are constantly thinking about the past and the future you lose out on the present moment where all the opportunities lie. The trick is to live as if you would live forever and live as if you would die tomorrow. If you are constantly living in the past or the future, worried by what has happened or afraid by what has yet to come, your thinking will be impaired. Live with immediacy and now.
