I wanted to share Ed Catmull’s take on how creativity is supported within groups of people. As the director of Pixar, Catmull has some authority when it comes to creativity. These are notes that I took from General Electric’s conference _Minds and Machine_ last year.

“For me creativity is the process by which we solve problems,” he revealed “Failure is a necessary consequence of doing something new,” he added. “Change is going to happen and nothing is going to stop it.” There were so many gems flowing out of the creative producer that it was hard to keep track. “It is better to fix the errors than to find them all.” Catmull emphasized that the first step is not about looking for good ideas, but instead assembling teams and focusing on the dynamics of how people interact with each other.

He explained the four principles behind the braintrust, which essentially is a group of smart advisors. The first principle is about keeping the environment peer-to-peer, instead not boss-to-employee. If there is a boss-to-employee structure, then the employees will fear saying what is really on their mind. It is also paramount to remove the power structure from the room by forbidding the group director to tell the group what to do. The third principle is about shared ownership in each other’s success. This sounds simple, but aligning incentives is crucial.

The fourth is about creating an environment where people will save to contribute and listen. As Catmull likes to say, “talent was there, we just had to remove barriers and allow their creativity to flower.” The issue is that a room full of ambitious and smart people have different points of view. This often translates into meetings turning into a disaster. The diversity of viewpoints is good, however, if it is harnessed in the right way. When the ego disappears, magic starts to happen. When people are not attached ideas magical things happen.

That’s it. Keep those four principles in mind, and any work in groups will be more productive.

As a side note, when I asked him afterwards about any rituals he kept to stay creative, he said that he strikes a balance between meditation and a calm environment and the dynamic environment of chaos which he thrives in.
