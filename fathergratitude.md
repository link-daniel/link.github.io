I wouldn’t be where I am today without my father and grandfather. This sounds obvious. We are part of an evolutionary line of generations, a part of history. It is easy to forget, however, where you come from. It is easy to forget the people that matter.

As my newsfeed populated with father’s day images today, I wanted to take some time to reflect on my father’s life. Sort of cliche. I find that writing helps me to crystalize my thinking. Perhaps I wanted to remind myself where I come from. Most likely, I wanted to express gratitude for everything my father has made possible. Naturally, the best way to do that is call him. Second best is talking about my amazing dad on the internet. I wanted to share one story about my father’s life that represents his spirit and was probably imbued in me unconsciously.

Born and raised on a small farm by the countryside somewhere in Europe, my father learned from an early age to be self-reliant and think for himself. His mother died of a rare type of cancer when he was only three years old. My father barely had a childhood since he worked on the farm whenever he wasn’t at school. He walked forth and back to school every day for hours. When he returned from school, he worked on the farm. He took care of the animals on the farm, chopped wood and helped planting and harvesting crops. Most of the work remained manual labor as his father didn’t have proper machines and equipment. In the evening, he worked on his homework, often lighting a candle as the house didn’t have any electricity.

Life was harsh for the family, and his father did not manage the farm very well. His childhood was largely filled with physical labor, but it instilled in him a strong sense of work ethic. Growing up in poverty without a mother taught him to take responsibility and make his own decisions. Despite his bad luck, he was determined not to let that define the rest of his life.

As I grew up in slighter better conditions, I never heard my father complain about his upbringings. The strong sense for self-reliance and accepting your initial position in life, but being determined to improve it is something that I am proud of when I reflect on my father’s life.

It’s something that I constantly need to remind myself, to not complain about my situation, and retain hope for the future despite what has happened in the past or where you come from.

Everyone starts out differently in life, and sometimes we lack empathy of where other people come from. Not just in terms of where they are born, but also the upbringing they had, the opportunities they had or didn’t have, the problems they were facing, the environment they grew up in. Understanding this carries value as it makes everyone unique. It gives everyone a different perspective on life.

Talking to my father briefly today, it is inspiring to know that no matter where you are coming from, it does not need to define where you are going. You can shape your own destiny.

As French Enlightenment philosopher said, “each player must accept the cards life deals him or her: but once they are in hand, he or she alone must decide how to play the cards in order to win the game.”
