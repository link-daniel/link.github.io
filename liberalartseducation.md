#### The Value of a Liberal Arts Education

Hortus Deliciarum by Herrad of Landsberg

---

> “A liberal education demands that you live self-consciously. It prepares you to seek and define the meaning inherent in all you do. It has made you an analyst and critic of yourself, a person in this way supremely equipped to take charge of your life and how it unfolds. It is in this sense that the liberal arts are liberal — as in liberare — to free. They empower you with the possibility of exercising agency, of discovering meaning, of making choices.” — Drew Faust

The other day a friend at Harvard shared with me this transcript of a baccalaureate service that was given on June 8th, 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, by Drew Gilpin Faust, the 28th president of Harvard University.

As I was always curious about a liberal arts education, as Germany doesn’t really have one on the university level. In Germany, or Europe in general students focus after high school. You want to be a doctor? You study medicine. You want to be a lawyer? You study law. You don’t know what you want to do? Focus, anyway.

In a world where everyone is getting more options, closing doors early is actually helpful. Life is not about increasing options. Life is about closing options and becoming really good something.

To continue Drew Faust’s narrative:

> The surest way to have a meaningful, happy life is to commit yourself to striving for it. Don’t settle. Be prepared to change routes. Remember the impossible expectations we have of you, and even as you recognize they are impossible, remember how important they are as a lodestar guiding you toward something that matters to you and to the world. The meaning of your life is for you to make.

I still remember a guest speaker coming to my undergraduate university, telling us how a liberal arts education gives dividends over a life time. At the beginning, however, upon graduation, a liberal arts education is a disadvantage, he said.

Others like Steve Jobs, who never even finished university, disagree:

> Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great… **None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me.** And we designed it all into the Mac. — Steve Jobs, Commencement Speech at Stanford

It seems to be an endless debate — the value of a liberal arts education. While some call it irrelevant, some call it liberating. At the end everyone has to decide for themselves. And surely that is something that my liberal arts education taught me. Think independent. Think for yourself.

Perhaps it is to quote Faust again that “the liberal arts are liberal — as in liberare — to free,” and that is what makes all the difference. You let someone explore what their interests are rather than force them to a specific curriculum. And that is what unleashes potential.

“The meaning of your life is for you to make it,” Faust ended her speech. And so what is right for you may or may not be right for the other person, and so what you need to do is think independent, and think for yourself to get to that point. And if a more specialized undergraduate is better for you, so be it. But one thing that my liberal arts education taught me is to think for myself. And that is something very valuable, indeed.”
