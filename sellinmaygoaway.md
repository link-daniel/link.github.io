An uncommon assessment of the old trading adage

"Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect." Mark Twain

Every year with May around the corner, financial analysts and experts are ready to offer you advice on whether or not you should follow that old trading adage of Sell in May, Go Away.
The strategy dictates that if you sell your stock holdinds during the summer period of May to October, you will fare better.

Following popular trading patterns, however, make for poor returns. After all investors usually do not outperform the market when they find themselves constantly on the side of the majority.
If the market is a forward looking indicator, is the effect of the pattern priced in long before May arrives? And how well does the strategy do historically?

Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch estimated that the May-October period poses the highest risk of any other six-month period.

Data from S&P Capital IQ showed that bonds during the summer period outperformed the S&P 500 on average by more than 4% since 1977.

Gerstein Fisher calculated that 8 of the worst 10 months historically occurred in either May, June, July, August, September or October.

A study by the American Economic Review in 2002 discovered that returns on the stock market "in 36 out of 37 countries studied from 1970 to 1998 were higher in the November to April period than they were in the May to October period."

Another study published in Econ Journal Watch in 2004, however, attributed the higher return to extreme data points, such as the October 1987 crash or the 1998 collapse of LTCM.

This year on April 30th the S&P 500 closed at the 1,884 mark. More than fifteen trading days into May, the S&P 500 is still trading higher.

But the S&P did not do so well in the last couple of years in the month of May.

In 2010, the European debt crisis triggered a sell off in May.

In 2011, Greece and Portugal dragged stocks lower in May.

In 2012, debate on Grexit caused stocks to trade lower in May.

In 2013, the Fed's warning that stimulus may be pulled back sooner than expected lowered stocks. Nonetheless, in 2012 and 2013, stocks traded higher by the end of the summer.

This summer there are many things to worry about. The ongoing crisis in the Ukraine. China's fragile credit system. European elections. And the gradual end of quantitative easing in the U.S.

For the past 31 months the S&P 500 did not have a pullback of 10% or more. Usually, or since 1945, the average time frame for the S&P 500 to pullback by 10% or more is 18 months.

Markets are like rubber bands. If they stretch too far into one direction, they have to be relaxed eventually.
Don't listen to anybody telling you whether or not you should sell or keep your stocks in May, or any month for that matter.
Warren Buffett once said that "a public-opinion poll is no substitute for thought." In the same vein a trading pattern is no substitute for thought.
Do your homework and think for yourself.
