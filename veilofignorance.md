_This is an essay from my undergraduate years at the London School of Economics. I thought maybe someone could use it, in whatever way. Beware academic language._

This essay will argue that the two principles that Rawls derives from engaging in a thought experiment called the veil of ignorance are most likely to be the ones that we should or would choose in order to determine fair and just principles to govern our lives in society. However, I want to raise one key objection and demonstrate how this objection is important in Rawl’s overall argument.

The first part of the objection is concerned with incentives, and I want to show why only allowing inequalities if they help the worst off can discourage people to work hard and encourage people to be less industrious. The second part of the objection is concerned with effort, and there I want to explain why Rawls might be wrong when he says that talents and skills were arbitrarily given to us, and therefore we need to adjust for the imbalances that were created by nature.

This is important because talents and skills are not only a product of our natural abilities but also a combination of time and effort that is required to nurture those talents. The purpose of this essay is then two-fold. In the first part, I will defend Rawl’s two principles by arguing that it is likely that behind a Rawlsian veil of ignorance we would agree upon those principles. In the second part, I will focus on the key objection and show why it is important for the derivation of his two principles. If the objection is valid, then this essay will have acknowledged that the equality and difference principles are likely to be the ones that we will derive from a Rawlsian veil of ignorance but also realize that they to be slightly changed to account for the objection.

Rawls derives the two principles by asking what kind of principles people would agree to in an initial situation of equality. In other words, he engages us in a thought experiment in which no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status; nor does he know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence and strength, and the like. [[1]](https://medium.com/p/ddf934db5208/edit#_ftn1)

From this hypothetical contract, he derives two principles. The first principle requires an equal assignment of basic liberties and duties. Each person should have an equal right to the most extensive liberties compatible with similar liberties for all and the first principle always has priority over the first one as matters of liberty take precedent over utility and welfare. [[2]](https://medium.com/p/ddf934db5208/edit#_ftn2)

Therefore it would not be rational to agree to a principle, which would deprive a minority of certain liberties or rights as everyone can possibly end up being in that minority. Instead we want to give each person the same rights and liberties. To illustrate this further no one should be deprived of freedom of speech or religion. We can also expect people to be more risk averse when it comes to matters concerning the distribution of rights and duties.

The second principle arranges social and inequalities so that a) offices and positions are open to all under conditions of equality of opportunity and b) they are to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged persons. [[3]](https://medium.com/p/ddf934db5208/edit#_ftn3) For example, if life was a marathon, then we want to ensure that everyone is starting at the same position and everyone has the same opportunity to run the race.

Further to account for the second part of the second principle, we want to ensure that those people who are naturally running faster, while not necessarily being slowed down to achieve equality, in some way take care of the ones that are not naturally good at running. From this analogy we can extrapolate that whoever becomes rich in a society does not become so only because of his innate abilities but also on account of the institutions and the way society is generally set up.

Therefore, it makes sense that behind a Rawlsian veil of ignorance we would choose a difference principle of some sort, the only question remains in which way are we going to account for the imbalances that nature has created.

In order to understand the key objection that was raised earlier, I briefly want to explain what makes some people more successful than others. In this context, the result of success creates an inequality in wealth, power or status. There are two components that lead someone to be successful in life. The first component is external and includes factors that are out of one person’s control and therefore can be ascribed as arbitrary. The second component is internal and includes factors that are within one person’s control and therefore cannot be attributed to luck or arbitrariness. If we accept Rawl’s premise of the Rawlsian veil of ignorance, then we should account for imbalances that are primarily due to external or arbitrary factors.

Lets take the example of Warren Buffett as an illustration to show why there are both internal and external factors to his success. He was born in the United States, and the fact that his talent of allocating capital is valued by society can be seen as arbitrary or external factors. However, Mr. Buffett did not choose where he was born, neither did he choose that whatever talents he had were highly valued by society. There are some elements to his success, which were therefore external such as being able to go to college, which allowed him to build on his talents. In that regard we can understand why in one way or another he should be giving back to society, and the difference principle makes sense.

However there are also internal factors that contribute to a person’s success. Therefore, if I can show that a person’s success is not only dependent upon arbitrary factors, but also upon factors that are within one’s own control, then we need to acknowledge that Rawl’s difference principle is not adequate or in the least needs to be changed to allow people creating inequalities that not necessarily benefit the worst off. Let us take the example of Bill Gates, who became one of the richest people in the world by revolutionizing the computer industry.

There are many external or arbitrary factors that certainly helped him to become very successful. However, as Collins argues there were thousands of people like Bill Gates who had the same opportunities as him. [[4]](https://medium.com/p/ddf934db5208/edit#_ftn4) He was not the only person who grew up in an upper middle-class American family, nor was he the only one who had access to computing or computer resources.

Rawls argues that distributive justice is not about rewarding virtue or moral desert. Instead, it is about meeting the legitimate expectations that arise once the rules of the game are in place. Once the principles of justice set the terms of social cooperation, people are entitled to the benefits they earn under the rules. [[5]](https://medium.com/p/ddf934db5208/edit#_ftn5) If inequality were only a function of external factors, then surely Rawls would have a valid point saying that inequalities are only justified if they benefit the worst off. The problem is that for Rawls talents and skills are innate abilities, something that we were born with. If this is true, then we can understand Rawls arguing for allowing inequalities only to happen if it benefits the worst off.

But if talents and skills are not only a function of external factors, then we need to allow inequalities regardless of whether it confers benefits on the worst off or not. In order to know whether an inequality is legitimate or not, it is not enough to see whether it benefits the worst off or not. Inequality does not necessarily mean that someone is better of at the expense of someone else. Therefore, we need to look at the process of how inequality is being created. If the factors are external and arbitrary, then we can use the difference principle to account for the imbalances, but if the factors are internal and non-arbitrary, then the difference principle cannot apply.

Thus, if we recognize a distinction between how inequality is created, then we would need an updated difference principle building on Rawl’s foundation of justice but incorporating the distinction. Further some of the decisions that people make that create inequalities are not made within a political structure, but within families or private associations and so considering that the difference principle is supposed to regulate political justice, we can question its applicability outside of the political realm.

This essay has argued that the two principles that Rawls derives from engaging in a thought experiment known as the veil of ignorance is intuitively powerful, and lays on strong foundation as the two principles are for the most part principles that we would agree upon behind a Rawlsian veil of ignorance. However, I have also argued that the difference principle is somewhat incomplete insofar as it does not account for a distinction in how inequalities arise. For Rawls inequality is mostly stemming out of arbitrary and external factors, and inequalities are therefore only justified if they benefit the worst off. However, I have showed that we need to look at the process of inequality in order to determine its legitimacy.

We cannot simply say that inequalities are inherently bad or good. It depends how inequalities are created. Neither do we have an obligation to benefit the worst off every time we create an inequality by working on our talents and skills and therefore reaping rewards. Talents and skills are partly something that we were born with, but also partly something that we have worked on. Therefore, we need to add another layer to the difference principle, if we want to acknowledge that the legitimacy of inequality is not only dependent upon whom it is benefitting but also how it was created.
