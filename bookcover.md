> “Bad artists copy, great artists steal.” — Picasso

Though creative and original work isn’t directly derived from stealing, artists do get their inspiration from others and morph their new ideas into something more creative. T. S. Eliot once wrote, “Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different.” There is a fine line between stealing an idea and using it as an inspiration; it is a fact, however, that for someone to develop their own style, they must first learn from the masters that came before them, using their techniques, copying them, and then altering them into something truly original.As Steve Jobs once mentioned, “It comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best things that humans have done and then try to bring those things in to what you’re doing.”

A couple of years ago, on a visit to the [Top of the Rock](https://www.topoftherocknyc.com/) in New York City on a summer afternoon, I started to take pictures of myself overlooking the city. It wasn’t grande or anything special. I wouldn’t even call this art, given that I spend a couple of hours enjoying myself on a rooftop overlooking Central Park and downtown Manhattan, but after a couple of shots, I was into it.

A man overlooking Manhattan? Nothing special for sure, and probably thousands of people took photos like this. But then again, hundreds of thousand more have taken ordinary photos where they are smiling and facing the camera. Yet I was proud that only with an iPhone 4 and a bit of inspiration I was able to take a memorable photo like that.

Only a couple of months later, I got an email from an Italian publisher, asking if I was interested to commission my photo for the cover of the Italian translation of an American novel called _An American Type_ by Henry Roth. Maybe I was lucky, but as an immigrant, I couldn’t stop smiling that I would be on a book cover with that kind of title.

Years later when I attended graduate school, the same photo became a finalist in a photo competition. Again nothing too fancy, but I was proud of how much I was able to leverage that one photo, with one simple idea. And this leads me to my bigger point of this post.

We often think that to make original art we need to sit in a room, and have meditated on it for months. We come up with reasons why this or that isn’t possible, because we don’t have money, the equipment or the right resources.

The truth is that sometimes it takes very little to create a masterpiece. Look at how far this one photo got! It was just a simple idea, matched with an inspiration from an old painting, and an iPhone 4. I didn’t even use a professional camera, and yet it was printed on a cover of a book.

You may look at this photo, and assume there’s nothing special about it, or you even argue that there’s nothing original about it. The point of this, however, is to show you what comes from the effects of one master: a simple man taking a photo of himself and having it placed on a book cover. Imagine what amazing things you can create from a bit of inspiration and with the smallest of resources. As Einstein said, “Sometimes the secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.”
