I have taken some notes when Mark Zuckerberg spoke at Vanity Fair’s New Establishment summit last year in San Francisco, but never got around to publish them, so here they are…

“Every 10 to 15 years there is a new computing platform that comes along,” proclaimed Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, at this year’s Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit. Of course he was referring to virtual reality, a platform he described as intuitive and immersive.

This is just part of technology’s quest of equipping people with richer and richer tools. And with Facebook’s acquisition of Oculus, one of the leading companies in that space, Zuckerberg is charging ahead full speed. Oculus’s mission? To make it possible to experience anything, anywhere.

As Zuckerberg explained, a lot of things in technology come down to cost and power. Once the cost comes down and the power goes up, more people are able to participate. “The 250 million people who own an Xbox, PlayStation, or wii will likely be the first VR adopters,” he noted. The great thing about virtual reality is that you don’t have to invent a screen or something. You can just dive in with the little equipment that is necessary.

On another note, Zuckerberg talked about connecting the rest of the world to the Internet and why it matters. “Internet connectivity is a fundamental challenge of our generation,” he revealed. Indeed, there are 4 billion people that have no Internet, yet 90% live within range of 2G and 3G signals.

One challenge, he revealed, is that many of those people that don’t have access to the Internet didn’t grow up with a computer. Justifying to pay for a data plan is tricky. But at its basic level, the Internet can provide vital information for these people in terms of health care, education and potential jobs. Once they see that value, they can easily justify purchasing that data plan.

“It turns out everything impactful you want to do has controversy,” Zuckerberg said, when he shared with the audience that for a free basic services such as Facebook there need to be ads, otherwise it won’t be sustainable. But he tried to re-assure everyone, “I think we’ll actually get to a point where the ads are meaningful experiences and add something positive to FB.”
