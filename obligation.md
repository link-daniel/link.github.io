“Government should do for people only what they can’t do better by themselves.” — Lincoln

“I believe that every right implies a responsibility; every opportunity, an obligation; every possession, a duty.” — John D. Rockefeller

This is a brief on the concept of obligation that I prepared for my exam on political philosophy at the London School of Economics. May it help you in whatever way you deem necessary. It’s not complete, but it’s quite extensive.

It covers obligation to obey laws, authority of states, interest theory, will theory, and rights. This is a resource, not an essay.

“Critiques Of” includes philosophers or ideas that challenge the topic. “Importance Of” explains the most important points on the topic from the philosopher’s point of view. And “Excerpts Of”, as the name suggests, offers a few quotes by the philosopher.

### I POLITICAL OBLIGATION IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

#### MEANING OF THE STATE AND HOW OBLIGATION IS DERIVED:
T.H. Greene (1879): To discover the true ground or justification for obedience to law. For Green, and for almost everyone else who has pondered it, the problem of political obligation is a moral problem, and the obligation in question is a kind of moral obligation.

Political obligation is the obligation to obey each law because it is the law, and not necessarily because we think it has some independent moral justification. We do not object to the law against murder because murder is clearly morally wrong. However, there are laws that have little grounding in morality. When the state is using some of our taxes to build nuclear warheads, for example. (Wolff, 2006)

To have a political obligation is to have a moral duty to obey the laws of one’s country or state.

“All that makes existence valuable to any one depends on the enforcement of restraints upon the actions of other people.” J.S. Mill

Negative justification: If we agree with Mill’s claim and also believe that the idea of enforceable restraints without the state is mere wishful thinking, then any further argument about justification seems idle.

What is the state? Political power as the right to make laws, with the right to punish those who fail to obey them; states possess a monopoly of legitimate violence (Weber)

Weber: “A state is a human community that claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory.”

Within any state, violence or coercion is seen as primarily the state’s business, either directly, through its agents — the police and law courts — or indirectly, through the permissions it gives its citizens to be violent to each other on occasion: in self defense, for example. All legitimate violence or coercion is undertaken or supervised by the state. (Wolff, 2006)

The state accepts the responsibility of protecting everyone who resides within its borders from illegitimate violence. Surely it is only for this reason that we are prepared to grant the state its monopoly of violence. We forfeit the right to protect ourselves only on the understanding that we do not need self-protection: the state will do what is necessary for us. (Wolfff, 2006)

Two essential features of the state: the state maintains a monopoly of legitimate coercion or violence and it offers to protect everyone within its territory. In reality however, no state can live up to that ideal. (Wolff, 2006)

The idea is that political obligation are universal in the sense that they apply to all people who reside within the border of the state. The goal of justification of the state is to show that, in principle, everyone within its territories is morally bound to follow its laws and edicts. (Wolff, 2006)

Wolff (2006): ‘Example of Ambassadors’ Most people have a political obligation, but even if there are some independents who do not this does not necessarily constitute a problem. Consider the example of ambassadors, and others with diplomatic immunity. In one sense, the state in which they live has no authority over them. But this does not mean that the agents of the state must permit such diplomats to act however their whims take them.
John Searle: The reality of the state as that of a social union performing status functions through its collective intentionality.

The state is, as Hobbes said, an artificial man.

Knowles (2010): Conclusions

We often have good moral reasons, and even moral duties or obligations to perfom in the ways the law makes institutionally obligatory. We have good moral reasons not to harm or deceive innocent persons, to promote justice, feed the hungry, and rescue the imperiled, quite apart from the law’s requirements and prohibitions, just as we have reasons not to unreasonably offend, inconvenience, or frustrate others. A duty to obey the law would add only another kind of reason to those reasons we already have for respecting others and treating them well.

Even decent or reasonably just states have despite their virtues, usually done great wrongs in their pasts, and they continue to do unimpressive jobs of solidifying social hierachies, of institutionalizing condescending and moralizing attitudes of threatening and controlling persons and nations outside their territories, and so on. None of this is news: even the best states and legal systems with which we are familiar are far from unqualified moral blessings.

I can instead choose to live in this state while recognizing it for what it is — an historically contingent organization that has amassed its enormous power by frequently dubious means, in the process doing considerabe good and averting considerable evil — and while trying my best to treat others well and to advance good ends as morality mandates. I can choose to contract or cooperate with others, undertaking the duties of a willing promiser or cooperator; or I can keep to myself and let others exclude me from their schemes as best they can. If I love my state, I can always freely choose to bind myself to it. If I hate my state, I may leave it in search of better. Or I may choose to live where I am only a “citizen of the world”, bound to no polity, but only to discharge those moral duties that each person owes naturally to every other.

The mere necessity of the state cannot be itself suffice to locate authority claims. Nor can the mere salience of existing institutions and officials.

#### SOCRATES IN PLATO’S CRITO
Socrates conclusion: he is morally bound to virtually absolute obedience to the law, even where the law wrongly imposes a sentence of death.
Laws are like a father and master to Socrates “either persuade it or do what it commands”: Socrates maintains that his long residence in Athens shows that he has entered into an agreement with its laws and committed himself to obey them — an argument that anticipates the social contract or consent theory of political obligation.

What he owes to the laws he owes because of his identity, because of roles or positions he occupies. He finds himself in the unchosen role of the Laws child and servant, a role that carries with it a duty of honor and obedience.

The state and the laws, in raising him, have given Socrates a share of all the fine things available to it: He acknowledges that he owes his birth, nurture, and education, among other goods, to the laws of Athens, and he hints at the gratitude theory of obligation when he concludes that it would be wrong of him to disobey its laws now

The second argument emphasizes not who Socrates has become or the roles he plays in the state. It emphasizes instead what Socrates has received from the Laws workings. Athens has under the Laws direction, given Socrates many significant benefits, some of which Socrates actually mentions but many more of which we can easily imagine.

By his act of staying, agreeing with the laws to do what they demand of him: He appeals to what is now known as the argument from fairness or fair play when he suggests that disobedience would be a kind of mistreatment of his fellow citizens.

The third argument refers to what Socrates has done. He has freely, if only tacitly or implicitly, consented or agreed to abide by the verdicts of Athens courts.

#### EXCERPTS FROM CRITO
“If we leave here without the city’s permission, are we mistreating people whom we should least mistreat?”
“Do you think it possible for a city not to be destroyed if the verdicts of its courts have no force but are nullified and set at naught b private individuals?”

#### DIVINE COMMAND
Christian doctrine held that there is an obligation to obey the law grounded in divine command: “For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore he who resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.”

First, it presupposes the existence of divinity of some sort; and second, the commands of the divine being(s) are not always clear.
One such response was to distinguish the divinely ordained office from the officer who occupied it.
According to Martin Luther and others who drew this distinction, Christians may not actively resist their rulers, but they must disobey them when the rulers’ commands are contrary to God’s.

A third response was to note the possibility of conflict between two or more of one’s rulers

#### THE SOCIAL CONTRACT
Hobbes ‘Social contract theory established the authority of anyone who was able to wield and hold power.’

The subjects consent to obey those who have effective power over them, whether the subject has a choice in who holds power or not.

The upshot of Hobbes’s theory seems to be that we have an obligation to obey anyone who can maintain order.

Locke ‘The free and equal individuals in the state of nature establish government as a way of overcoming the “inconveniencies” of that state.’

In the first stage the naturally free and equal individuals agree to form themselves into a political society, under law, and in the second they establish the government. This move allows Locke to argue for a right of revolution on the ground that overthrowing the government will not immediately return the people to the state of nature.

Locke’s it seems that there are some things to which we cannot consent.

One problem has to do with the nature of the contract: is it historical or hypothetical?

The second problem has to do with the way Hobbes and Locke rely on tacit consent.

Hume ‘The obligation to obey the law derives not from consent or contract but from the straightforward utility of a system of laws that enables people to pursue their interests peacefully and conveniently.’

To say, he protests, that most people have given their consent to obey the laws simply by remaining in their country of birth is tantamount to saying that someone tacitly consents to obey a ship’s captain “though he was carried on board while asleep and must leap into the ocean and perish the moment he leaves her”

#### UTILITY AND OBLIGATION
On utilitarian grounds, the state is justified if and only if it produces more happiness than any alternative. Whether we consent to the state is irrelevant. What matters is whether it makes the members of society, in total, happier than they would be without it. (Wolff, 2006)

Utilitarians have trouble accounting for obligations of any kind.

If one’s guiding principle is always to act to maximize expected utility, or promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number, then obligations seem to have little or no binding force. After all, if I can do more good by giving the money in my possession to charity than by paying my debts, then that is what I should do, notwithstanding my obligations to my creditors.

Wolff (2006): Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism requires one to perform the action that will create more happiness in the world than any other action available at the time. However it is hard to quantify happiness.

The problem of finding a way of comparing happiness is known as the problem of ‘interpersonal comparisons of utility’

Bentham: “We should obey our rulers as long as the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs.”

Prisoner’s dilemma: action which individually increases happiness collectively diminishes it.

Indirect utilitarianism: If you personally set out with the single goal of becoming happy, and do, everything you can to become happy, more likely than not you will fail. But if you aim at something else — form and pursue an ambition, get a hobby, make some good friends — you may well find happiness as a side-effect or indirect consequence.

The best we can do is set ourselves other goals, or follow other rules, in the hope or expectation that happiness will follow as a consequence.

Wolff (2006): Three Utilitarian Laws

Laws should be passed if, and only if, they contribute more to human happiness than any competing law (or the absence of law) would do.

Laws should be obeyed because they are laws (and will be obeyed because disobedience means punishment), and should only be disobeyed to avoid disaster.

Laws should be repealed and replaced if they fail to serve the proper utilitarian function.

Wolff (2006): Three premises of Utilitarianism

The morally best society is the one in which happiness is maximized.

The state promotes happiness better than the state of nature.

The state and the state of nature are the only alternatives we have.

Therefore, we have a moral duty to bring about and support the state

Wolff (2006): Scapegoat objection: utilitarianism will permit enormous injustice in the pursuit of general happiness. Scapegoatism is justified on utilitarian grounds provided it is highly efficient and secret. This surely is a troubling thought.

Although the utilitarian justification of the state seems strong, utilitarianism itself is highly suspect, even in its indirect form. Thus there are reasons to be dissatisfied with this approach to the defence of the state. (Wolff, 2006)

Wolff (2006): Utilitarian arguments may well have unacceptable implications, as they seem to allow us to sacrifice the innocent.

#### OBLIGATION AND DUTY
Difference between obligation and duty is that obligations must be voluntarily undertaken or incurred, but duties need not be. The obligation to keep a promise or fulfill a contract arises only when one has done something that generates the obligation — made a promise or signed a contract — but the duties of charity and truth telling supposedly fall on us regardless of what, if anything, we voluntarily commit to do.

Rawls: Most citizens of a reasonably just political society have no general obligation to obey its laws, even though they do have a “natural duty” to support just institutions. Political obligation is grounded in a natural duty of some sort.

Knowles (2010): Political Obligations and Citizens’ duties

If we think of the state and its citizens as characters in a relationship we can describe the interactions between them as caring, cooperative and conflictive.

Whether or not citizens bear duties to their states may be conditional on whether the state fulfils its responsibilities, serving the prudential interests of its citizens and doing its duty to them, in turn. But the duties, or in the philosophical jargon, the political obligations, of the citizens are our prime concern.

Knowles (2010): Is there a duty to obey the laws?

Prima facie duty: to obey the law, a duty that can be overridden in the case of intolerably unjust laws.

Tentative duty: that is only actually a duty where such moral objections to law are not present.

It might be that even within a single reasonably just society, many persons have a moral duty to obey the law, while many others do not. Or it might be that typical citizens in familiar states have a moral duty to obey, but that this duty binds them more narrowly (or broadly) than they or their governments suppose. It might be that anarchists have been correct in insisting that all citizens of all states lack even a narrow moral duty to obey the law.

‘Associative vs Transactional accounts’ Associative accounts ground our duty to obey in our nonvoluntary occupation of certain duty-laden social roles. Transactional accounts ground our duty to obey in our morally significant interactions with our states or fellow citizens.

Natural Duty theories of the duty to obey the law are those that ground our duty to obey not in who we are or in what we have done or enjoyed but rather either in the moral importance of advancing some impartial moral good or in some moral duty thought to be owed by all persons to all others as moral equals, regardless of roles, relationships, or transactions.

#### OBLIGATION AND MORALITY
If there is an obligation or duty to obey the law as such, simply because it is the law, then it is an obligation to obey no matter what the content of a particular law may be. We may grant that the law carries moral force, in other words, but we cannot grant that it holds a monopoly on that kind of force.

‘Political obligations, or prima facie obligations, are morally binding, but not absolutely so.’ Like the obligation to keep a promise or meet the terms of a contract, the obligation to obey the law binds one to obedience, but it may be overridden in special circumstances, when other things are decidedly not equal.

Someone who is under a political obligation thus should presume that she has a duty to obey the laws of her polity, and she should consider disobedience only when it seems that obeying a particular law may be, on balance, the wrong course of conduct. To have political obligation, it is to have a general obligation to obey the laws of one’s polity as such. This general obligation though will not always require obedience to particular laws when all things are considered.

‘Dictates of morality; political obligations may be overriden because they are not fully moral obligations’ Like all genuine obligations, a political obligation has binding force — in this case, binding the obligated person to obey lawful commands. Yet it may be, that one need not, all things considered, obey that command. One may, indeed, be morally required not to do so.

Prima facie is not an obligation at all:
“It makes little sense to insist there is such an obligation if those who stand under it are entitled to exercise their own moral discretion regarding the propiety of their obedience to law.” According to this view, anyone who has a political obligation should always obey the law, being guilty of immoral conduct if he does not, or that no one ever has been or will be under a political obligation.

One may acknowledge that political obligations are truly binding, so that anyone who has such an obligation is bound to obey the law, but also acknowledge that this obligation must give way when it conflicts with moral obligations.

The soldier’s or sailor’s duty to obey order is undoubtedly a genuine and powerful obligation, but there are still circumstances in which it may and should be overridden.

Knowles (2010: What then are we to make of the obligation to obey the law?

There are two options available: we can continue to obey the law a political obligation but deny that it is a moral obligation, that one has a moral duty to obey the law. It is a distinct kind of obligation.

The alternative position is that we further specify the political obligation to obey the law as the obligation to obey just laws, more generally the duty to obey the laws of a just a decent state.

We can perfectly conclude that citizens have a duty to obey the law without having to deny that it is sometimes right to break the law (and sometimes right to obey it, despite the contrary duty)

Knowles (2010): And our natural moral duties, properly understood, cannot serve to direct our moral attention first and foremost to the local. If that is correct, then the denial of a general moral duty of domestic legal obedience can perfectly well be maintained even in conjunction with the acceptance of standard claims about the importance or necessity of states and legal systems to the provision of public goods.

#### OBLIGATION, POLITICAL AND LEGAL
Parekh: Political obligation is broader than legal and someone who has a truly political obligation will owe her polity more than mere obedience to its laws. Such a person will have a positive duty to take steps to secure her safety and advance the interests of her country.

Is political obligation civic duty?

Political obligations are systemic, and legal obligations are specific.

The problem of political obligation is the problem of determining whether there is a ground or justification for obedience to the law — not this or that law in particular but the law as such.

Legal obligations are specific rather than systemic, then, because legal philosophers are concerned with the question of what counts as a law with binding force, not with the moral justification of political systems that claim a right to be obeyed.

A political obligation is a moral duty that only a citizen or perhaps a permanent resident can have, for it is an obligation that attaches only to mebers of a polity. Legal obligations, by contrast, attach themselves to anyone who is subject to the pertinent law or laws, including tourists who owe no allegiance to the country they happen to be visiting.

Knowles (2010): Legal legitimacy

The state is acting illegitimately when it breaks its own rules and exceeds its proper powers.

A final mode of legal legitimacy is an external property of states that are recognized by other states or international agencies in accordance with international law.

### II ANARCHIST CHALLENGES TO POLITICAL OBLIGATION

#### PHILOSOPHICAL ANARCHISM
Robert Wolff: There can be no general obligation to obey the law because any such obligation would violate the primary obligation of autonomy, which is the refusal to be ruled.

Autonomy and authority are simply incompatible: if we acknowledge authority, we allow someone else to rule us, thereby violating our fundamental obligation to act autonomously.

All attempts to justify political obligations have failed: so we must conclude that only those relatively few people who have explicitly committed themselves to obey the law, perhaps by swearing allegiance as part of an oath of citizenship, have anything like a general obligation to obey the laws under which they live.

Wolff (2006): Anarchism revisted

The anarchist’s strongest weapon: no one asked me whether we should have a state, and the police does not request my permission to act as they do. Therefore, the state and the police act illegitimately, at least in respect of their dealings with me.

The philosophical anarchist recommends that we adopt a highly critical stance towards the activities of the police and the state. Sometimes they act with moral authority, but where they do not we are right to disobey, obstruct, or ignore them.

There must be some moral limit to the obligation to obey the law.

If we take anarchism to an extreme then we may end up with a situation in which people may follow their individual private judgment in all matters, even those of public concern. But it was for exactly this reason that Locke argued that we should move away from the state of nature.

Anarchism as dangerous example of moral self-indulgence? Having a shared set of laws is, within reason, much more important than anyone’s private judgment about what the best laws should be.

#### AGAINST PHILOSOPHICAL ANARCHISM
Wolff’s critiques argue that he is wrong to insist that moral autonomy is our primary or fundamental obligation for this would require us to think that autonomy will always override values such as not harming other people, supporting loved ones, doing a favor for a friend or even more mundane desires.

Gans: A kind of false or hypocritical radicalism

The critics arguethat philosophical anarchists fail to appreciate the social or embedded nature of human beings, which leads the anarchists to conceive of obligation in excessively individualistic or voluntaristic terms, which in turn leads to their denial of a general obligation to obey the law.

The best response to philosophical anarchists will be to produce or defend a theory of obligation that proves to be immune to their objections.

#### III CONTEMPORARY THEORIES OF POLITICAL OBLIGATION

Providing a constitution for public international law, the United Nations system was agreed during World War II.
VOLUNTARISTIC OBLIGATION (Wolff, 2006)

Locke: political power over me can be created only as a consequence of my voluntary acts. Another person can have political power over me only if I have granted them that power.

Self-assumption principle: no one has any duties whatsoever unless we have assumed those duties, that is, voluntarily undertaken them. However, it seems that we must accept that we have some moral duties, whether or not we have agreed to them.

To rebut Locke, in order to justify the state it is not enough simply to point out how much better off we would be under the authority of the state than in the state of nature. We would also have to show that each person has voluntarily consented to the state.

For Locke, even if it is true that the state is to my advantage, it does not follow, for Locke, that the state is justified. For I have a natural right to freedom, and so political power over me can be brought into existence only through my own consent. Accordingly, a state, which purpots to exercise political power over me, but which does not have my consent, has no right to govern and hence is illegitimate.

In abstract, social contract theory is an obvious, elegant solution to the problem of political obligation. It satifies the twin demands of universalism — every person must be obligated — and voluntarism — political obligations can come into existence only through consent.

Realistically not many people have given consent to legitimize the state. The only people, who give their consent, are those that gain their citizenship through naturalization.

Is not voting a form of not giving consent to the government?

Another view is that political obligations can only arise when society is arranged as a participatory democracy, in which all citizens take an active role in government.

Wolff (2006): Voluntaristic defenses within the contract tradition cannot explain the obligations of those who refuse to consent.

#### CONSENT
For Locke the problem of justifying the state is to show how its authority can be reconciled with the natural autonomy of the individual. His answer is to appeal to the idea of individual consent, and the device of the social contract. He gives great weight to the idea of personal autonomy or natural liberty. (Wolff, 2006)

Locke: “I moreover affirm, that all men are naturally in the state of nature, and remain so, till their own consents they make themselves members of some political society; and I doubt not in the sequel of this discourse, to make it very clear.”

Too few people have given the kind of express or actual consent that can ground a general obligation to obey the law, and neither hypothetical nor tacit consent will supply the defect.

Harry Beran (1987): He accepts the claim that only express consent can generate a political obligation, but calls for political societies to establish formal procedures for evoking such consent. That is, states should require their members openly to undertake an obligation to obey the law or to refuse to do so.

Plamenatz (1968) & Steinberger (2004): Voting or otherwise participating in elections should count as consent, and Steinberger produces a lengthy list of fairly ordinary activities — calling the police or fire deparment for help, sending children to a public school, using a public library.

Gilbert: “Surrender of judgment is a kind of consent” or “Joint commitment” is an important source of obligations

Generally the clash is on how broadly our understanding of what counts as consent is defined.

Wolff (2006): Tacit consent. The central thought is that by quietly enjoying the protection of the state one is giving it one’s tacit consent.

Locke: “Every man that has any possession, or enjoyment, of any part of the dominions of any government, does thereby give his tacit consent, and is as far forth obliged to obedience to the laws of that government, during such enjoyment as any one under it; whether this possession be of land to him and his hear forever, or a lodging only for a week; or whether it be barely traveling freely on the highway.”

Receiving benefits is a way of tacitly consenting to the state, and it is the consent that binds one. Should we accept this claim?
Hume’s rebuttal is that residence alone cannot be construed as consent. Why not? Simply because nothing could count as dissent, except leaving the country.

Rousseau: Residence constitutes consent, but only within a free state. In a free state, Rousseau implies, the act of dissenting — leaving the territories of the state — is simple enough.

In the contemporary world, a world of nation-states, the doctrine of tacit consent seems far less appropriate than it did for Rousseau. The conditions for tacit consent are not met in the modern world. The state cannot be justified in these terms.

Wolff (2006): Hypothetical consent

If you were not under the authority of the state, and somehow found yourself in he state of nature, then, if you were rational, you would do everything in your power to recreate the state. In particular, you would rationally and freely join in a contract to bring about the state.
This does not satisfy the demands of the social contract theory though because hypothetical acts of consent are not acts.

The device of the hypothetical contract can now be thought of as a way of getting us to realize what we really think. The hypothetical contract argument is to reveal dispositional consent: an as-yet-unexpressed attitude of consent. But, unexpressed, even unacknowledged, dispositions to consent are rarely considered binding in other moral or legal contexts. Anarchists cannot be possibly said to have the disposition to consent to the state: they actively and explicitly dissent.

It seems that universalim — the thesis that everyone has political obligations — simply cannot be delivered by contract or consent theory in any of the forms discussed here.

Knowles (2010): My own preferred route is Lockean and involves affirming the natural right of all persons to enforce morality (by coercion, if necessary)

However powerful and central to our lies state and political community may be, they can legitimately do no more to us without our consent than could the persons who created and empowered them. And those persons were bound always to respect the rights to autonomy and nonaggression that all enjoy.

### GRATITUDE

Walker (1988):

The person who benefits from X has an obligation of gratitude not to act contrary to X’s interests

Every citizen has received benefits from the state

Every citizen has an obligation of gratitude not to act in ways that are contrary to the state’s interests

Noncompliance with the law is contrary to the state’s interests

Every citizen has an obligation to comply with the law

Walker holds that one may have an obligation of gratitude not only to other persons but also to institutions, including the state or polity
The second point is to evaluate the strength of obligations of gratitude itself

Walker (1988): “We can afford to acknowledge that the extent of our indebtedness to the state is less than his [Socrates], while still insisting that it grounds a strong, though not absolute, obligation of gratitude to comply with the law.”

#### FAIR PLAY
Hart: “When a number of persons conduct any joint enterprise according to rules and thus restrict their liberty, those who have submitted to these restrictions when required have a right to a similar submission from those who have benefited by their submission.”

Rawls (1964) ‘Duty of Fair Play’ What the principle of fair play holds, then, is that everyone who participates in a reasonably just, mutually beneficial cooperative practice has an obligation to bear a fair share of the burdens of the practice.

In this way the principle of fair play provides the grounding for a general obligation to obey the law, at least on the part of those whose polity is reasonably regarded as a cooperative enterprise.

Objection 1: Nozick objects that the principle of fair play would allow others to place us under an obligation to them simply by onferring benefits on us.

Objection 2: Smith: “the obligation of fair play governs a man’s actions only when some benefit or harm turns on whether he obeys”. This implies that the principle of fair play will generate an obligation to cooperate only when the cooperative enterprise is small enough that any participant’s failure to obey the rules could reasonably be expected to damage the enterprise. Political societies are not small, cooperative enterprises, however, and we can readily think of cases in which someone’s disobedience neither deprives anyone of any benefits nor harms the polity in any noticeable way.

Those who raise the third objection agree that considerations of fairness sometimes do generate obligations, but they insist, like Smith, that these considerations do not obtain in the political context. In this case, however, the complaint is that fair play considerations apply only to cooperative schemes that produce benefits one may refuse. If it produces nonexcludable goods, which everyone receives regardless of whether she contributed to their production or even wants them, then there can be no fair-play obligation to bear a share of the burdens of the enterprise.
There is a difference between receiving and acceptingbenefits, and receiving them is not enough to place someone under an obligation. If there is a political obligation, then, it cannot follow from the kind of nonexcludable goods that states provide.

Klosko (2005): If, in sum, a state may be reasonably regarded as a cooperative enterprise, and if it provides its members with goods that are presumptively beneficial — or “indispensable for satisfactory lives” — then its members have an obligation grounded in fairness to obey its laws.

Wolff (2006): The Principle of Fairness

It has been argued that anyone who gains an advantage from the state has a duty of fairness to obey its laws, to contribute taxes, and so on.
“When any number of persons conduct any joint enterprise according to rules, and thus restrict their liberty, those who have submitted to these restrictions when required have a right to similar submission from those who have benefited by their submission.”

Hume: His first step is to argue that each of us will profit if we live in a society governed by norms of justice, such as rules governing private property, and personal security. We will, of course, have to make short-term sacrifices, but justice pays in the longer term. As justice will only flourish if we all obey the law, then it turns out that obedience to the law is, in fact, in each person’s interest. If it is in our interest to obey the law, why do we need punishment? Hume’s answer is in effect that human beings are not very good at acting rationally.

Hume argues that we should set up a system of civil magistrates, who have the power to make laws and enforce them through punishment. Obedience to the laws is already to our long-term advantage, while punishing people for disobedience makes obedience in our short-term interest too. We need to be forced to act in our own self-interest.

Hart: We all benefit from the existence of the state, and it would be unfair to our fellow citizens to take those benefits without also accepting the burden necessary to create them. These burdens are political obligations. Hence we have a duty of fairness to accept the duty to obey the state.
Perhaps one acquires a duty of fairness to a duty of fairness to contribute, only if one accepts the benefits on the understanding of the costs. In the case of the public address system, you acquire a burden to tell jokes for a day only if you accept the scheme as a whole.

The fairness principle can only do so if we remain with Hart’s original formulation in terms of receipt of benefits. But as Nozick’s example shows, this itself leads to problematic consequences. So on this brief examination, it seems that the principle of fairness, although an improvement over consent theory, does not solve the problem of political obligation.

Wolff (2006): The fairness argument can only work if everyone accepts the benefits of the state and it is unlikely that this would be the case.

#### MEMBERSHIP OR ASSOCIATION

If we are members of a group, then we are under an obligation, to comply with the norms that govern it. Nor does this obligation follow from our consenting to become members, for it holds even in the case of groups or associations, such as families and politices, that people typically do not consent to join. Voluntary or not, membership entails obligation. Anyone who acknowledges membership in a particular polity must therefore acknowledge that he or she has a general obligation to obey its laws.

Political obligation is a form of non-voluntary obligation on a par with familial obligations

Dworkin: “Political association, like family and friendship and other forms of association more local and intimate, is in itself pregnant of obligation.”

Horton: My claim is that a polity is, like the family, a relationship into which we are mostly born: and that the obligations which are constitutive of the relationship do not stand in need of moral justification in terms of a set of basic moral principles or some comprehensive moral theory.

Hardimon: noncontractual role obligations — that is, obligations that simply flow from “roles into which we are born”

Voluntary and involuntary are not two parts of a dichotomy: there is a middle ground, and it is fertile soil for a theory of political obligation, just as it is for those who believe that being a member of a family entails obligations that we have neither chosen, on the one hand, nor incurred against our will, on the other.

A common intuition: a great many people apparently do think of themselves as members of political societies who have an obligation to obey their polities’ laws.

Obligation to obey the laws grows out of the sense of identity that members of a polity commonly share: if this is my polity, and I find myself thinking of its concerns as something that we members share, and its government as our government, then it will be easy to think also that I have an obligation to obey its laws.

Yael Tamir: “The true essence of associative obligations is that they are grounded on consent, reciprocity, or gratitude, but rather on a feeling of belonging or connectedness.”

Criticism 1: The analogy between the polity and the family is neither persuasive nor attractive. It is unpersuasive because the members of the modern polity lack the close and intimate relationships with one another that family members typically share; and it is unattractive because it raises the possibility that the paternalism appropriate within the family may be extended to the polity.

Criticism 2: As Wolff and other philosophical anarchists have argued, the fact that many people feel a sense of identity with and obligation to their countries does not mean that they really have such an obligation; nor need one be a philosophical anarchist to share this conclusion.

Criticism 3: All groups have members, including groups that are not decent, fair, or morally praiseworthy; but if membership is sufficient to generate an obligation to obey, then the members of unjust and exploitative groups will have an obligation to obey the rules. In the case of the polity, this leads to the unpalatable and counter-intuitive conclusion that the routinely exploited and oppressed “members” of an unjust polity are under an obligation to obey its laws.

Knowles (2010): Dworkin: defense of associate account of duty to obey; appeals to natural duty insofar that we have to honor our responsibilities under social practices that define groups and attach responsibilities to membership.

#### NATURAL DUTIES
One implication of this distinction is that most people have no general obligation to obey the laws of their polity, for they have not done what is necessary to incur such an obligation. Everyone, however, is subject to the natural duty of justice, which “requires us to support and to comply with just institutions that exist and apply to us”

Waldron: Insiders and Outsiders

A New Zealander, to use his example, has the special insider relation to the laws of New Zealand because those laws “have been set up precisely to address the question of the rights and duties of someone in his position vis-à-vis his fellow New Zealanders” (ibid., p. 284). Because they “apply” to him in a way they cannot apply to a citizen of another country, the example shows how the appeal to natural duty can handle the problem of particularity or special allegiance.

#### SAMARITANISM
The duty to be a good samaritan is a natural duty, on his account, because it “does not depend upon a previous transaction or preexisting association between the rescuer and the rescuee; if a person is sufficiently imperiled and one can save her at no unreasonable cost, one cannot justify one’s failure to rescue by pointing out that one never agreed to do so or that one had no morally significant relationship with her …” (2005, p. 36) Wellman then goes on to argue that “legal obedience is required as one’s fair share of helping to rescue others from peril” (2005, p. 45), including the “political peril … [that] is fundamentally a coordination problem” (2005, p. 38; emphasis in original)

#### A PLURALITY OF PRINCIPLES
For no one concept or principle by itself can ground a satisfactory theory of political obligation. In fact, that is a response that a number of philosophers have made, either implicitly or explicitly, in recent years.

Gilbert (2006) & Steinberger (2004): Hybrid theories without ever advertising them as such

Jonathan Wolff (2000) Call for pluralistic or multiple-principle approach to political obligations. There is no single answer to the problem of political obligation, because the problem has more than one aspect.

Not every “member” of a polity will stand in the same relation to its laws, for instance, which means that it is a mistake to think that everyone must have the same general obligation to obey. Nor is every obligation of equal force. Some are weak, such as the notorious obligation to stop at a traffic signal when no one else is around, and others are quite strong.

Criticism 1: the principle of fairness to supply the core of a justification, but to supplement it with appeals to natural duty and the common good
