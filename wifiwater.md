Whenever we move into a new place, the first question we ask is not whether the water is running, but whether the wifi is working. It is remarkable how important wifi has become to our lives over the past decade. In that sense, wifi has become just as essential as water. Indeed the first thing I did when I moved to my graduate dorm, after taking a shower, was making sure that I was connected to the university network.

Water and wifi are rather similar. They can be both at times abundant, and at other times scare. In the developed world, we often have access to clean water and fast wifi. In other parts of the world, access to clean water and fast wifi is scarce. Although as I am sitting in my dorm, and my wifi is barely working, I am reminded that sometimes it is the developed world that needs developing.

It is astonishing that a word that meant so little to our parents when they grew up, means everything to us millennials. Wifi, or cellular data by extension, rules the world. Just like water we take it for granted, and complain when we don’t have it. Life without wifi seems as dull as a world before colored television. We value the access to the internet so much that contemporary tech moguls such as Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, or companies such as Google work hard to connect everyone to the Internet.

But unlike water, we haven’t learned yet how to properly use wifi. The way we use wifi is if we had our water tap running constantly. We limit the consumption of water. I try to drink water as much as I can, but I probably couldn’t drink a bottle every hour. But using wifi at all times, that’s easy. The negative consequences are not immediate. When we wake up, we use wifi or cellular data to consume news, check our emails or write messages. After having done that, we check for more news and emails regularly throughout the day.

#### The New Mailman

It didn’t use to work that way. The mailman delivered the news. Our parents got one newspaper in the mail. They chose their favorite newspaper, and maybe an evening news program. The choice our parents had was in choosing which newspaper to read, but the newspaper dictated the content that they would read.

Today through the abundance of smart phones, tablets and laptops people no longer just read one newspaper. Because of the Internet, we no longer need the mailman to deliver our news. Although in a world that becomes increasingly digital, it is nice to read an actual newspaper. Through the Internet, we can access thousands of different of different newspapers around the world.

Not only can we access our favorite newspaper in multiple ways, we also can curate our own newspaper. We can read news from established, usually verified sources such as The New York Times or The Washington Post, or unverified sources from people who report through social media platforms such as Twitter. Because with the advent of blogs, where everyone can publish their opinion, the need for editorial content has never been higher.

If our goal is to understand what is happening in the world, then the abundance that has been unleashed through the combination of wifi and electronic tools, is extraordinary. But therein also lies a danger, because even though we have infinitely more ways to read the news, most people don’t have the judgment to distinguish between good and bad sources. The 24/7 news cycle is compelling, but can also be quite distracting. Finding the news that matters to you can be a job in itself.

#### Autonomy Over News

As millennials, the way we consume news is entirely different from our parents. Our parents got their news delivered to their door step. We get news delivered into our inboxes. Our parents read one newspaper and rely on the editorial control of that newspaper. We curate our own newspaper from different newspaper and consuming news shared by friends and people we trust and follow. Our parents read on a paper printed newspaper. We read from our phones and tablets through apps and social media.

Therefore, smart editorial control that gives consumers the choice of what kind of news what they what to consume, but the option to dig deeper into the news that they care about is important. That is why solutions such as NYT Now or Quartz Daily Brief, that gives you the most important events of the day in a few chunks of information, are great because they allow newspaper to set the agenda but allow also allow consumers to dive deeper into what they really care about. The way of the future is where newspapers set the agenda but retain autonomy for their consumers to choose what they care about.
