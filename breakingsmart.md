"Software is perhaps the most imagination-expanding technology humans have invented since writing and money, and possibly more powerful than either."

This new content series on the software technology revolution by @vgr, as part of his stint at Andreessen Horowitz, is so good that it deserves to be highlighted.

I recommend reading the entire essay series on "software is eating the world." It starts here with the introduction by Marc Andreessen. Its simple and profound.

But if you're short on time, or need more persuasion, here are some of my notes and highlights. This does not encapsulate everything, but at least my favorite parts. All credit goes to @vgr and @pmarca. All quotes credited to @vgr, unless otherwise noted.

It is much better to read the original essays, but if you want to get a glance first, read below. These are just my notes, so beware…

Marc Andresseen begins with an important insight that people are more apt at changing than most assume:

People change, then forget that they changed, and act as though they always behaved a certain way and could never change again. Because of this, unexpected changes in human behavior are often dismissed as regressive rather than as potentially intelligent adaptations. - Marc Andreessen

In his first post Venkatesh basically argues that we are underestimating the impact of this software revolution, which is on par with two other transformational technologies: writing and money.

Writing is very flexible: we can write with a finger on sand or with an electron beam on a pinhead. Money is even more flexible: anything from cigarettes in a prison to pepper and salt in the ancient world to modern fiat currencies can work. But software can increasingly go wherever writing and money can go, and beyond. Software can also eat both, and take them to places they cannot go on their own.

An interesting tidbit of information: what's often referred to as IoT, Internet of Things, has the potential to double the U.S. economy. The best case scenario for the economic potential of IoT is at over $14 trillion.

One potential this revolution has is transforming the way we look at certain assets. While the car represented freedom, and still does, freedom is shifting to the smartphone while the car is turning into an accessory.

There are four reasons why we underestimate technology revolutions

1. They are expontential in nature and we expect too much at the beginning
We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. - Roy Amara
"Change that often looks trivial or banal on the surface, but turns out to have been profound once the dust settles." - @vgr

2. Shift from installation to deployment phase
[Carlota] Perez demonstrates that the shift from installation to deployment phase for every major technology is marked by a chaotic transitional phase of wars, financial scandals and deep anxieties about civilizational collapse. One consequence of the chaos is that attention is absorbed by transient crises in economic, political and military affairs, and the apocalyptic fears and utopian dreams they provoke. As a result, momentous but quiet change passes unnoticed.
3. Much of the impact is disguised
4. Revolution is led by younger and younger people

He says this is an exception to the software revolution and historically most revolutions were led by young people. Just think of how young the Founding Fathers were. But he is right that this revolution is led by even younger people.

Operating in the margins by a hacker ethos - a problem solving sensibility based on rapid trial-and-error and creative improvisation - they are able to use software leverage and loose digital forms of organization to create new economic, social and political wealth. In the process, young people are indirectly disrupting politics and economics and creating a new parallel social order. Instead of vying for control of venerable institutions that have already weathered several generational wars, young people are creating new institutions based on the new software and new wealth.

"What the smartest people do on the weekend is what everyone else will do during the week in ten years." - Chris Dixon

His call to people, essentially what he refers to with "breaking smart", is either joining the revolution, or staying in the status quo.

"It is a choice we call breaking smart, and it is available to almost everybody in the developed world, and a rapidly growing number of people in the newly-connected developing world."

In the next part he lays out the four characteristics in how the future will emerge:

The US and Silicon Valley will continue to lead this race.

Small groups having large impact rather than big committees.

The world will improve gradually and continuously.

Rapid declines in the costs of solutions to problems.

He also has a take on the future of work:

Work will take on an experimental, trial-and-error character, and will take place in an environment of rich feedback, self-correction, adaptation, ongoing improvement, and continuous learning. The social order surrounding work will be a much more fluid descendant of today's secure but stifling paycheck world on the one hand, and liberating but precarious world of free agency and contingent labor on the other.

Next, he explains the clash between purists and pragmatists. "Until the early 1990s," he writes, "almost all important software began life as purist architectural visions rather than pragmatic hands-on tinkering."

But hands-on hacking soon replaced the purists. "The significance of pragmatic approaches prevailing over purist ones," he explains, "cannot be overstated: in the world of technology, it was the equivalent of the fall of the Berlin Wall."

"In software, what authoritarian architects find illegible and anxiety-provoking is the messy, unplanned tinkering hackers use to figure out creative solutions."

"As we will see in upcoming essays, enhanced information availability and lowered friction can make any field hacker-friendly. Once a field becomes hacker-friendly, software begins to eat it."

As a result of pragmatism prevailing, a nearly ungovernable Promethean fire has been unleashed. Hundreds of thousands of software entrepreneurs are unleashing innovations on an unsuspecting world by the power vested in them by "nobody in particular," and by any economic means necessary.

"In other words, true north in software is often the direction that combines ambiguity and evidence of fertility in the most alluring way: the direction of maximal interestingness."

That also means that there is a focus on prototyping.

"The great practical advantage of this heuristic is that the direction of maximal interestingness can be very rapidly updated to reflect new information, by evolving the rough consensus."

That does not mean that the product isn't complete. "It means the vision is perpetually incomplete," he explains, "and growing in unbounded ways, due to ongoing evolutionary experiments."

"Perpetual beta is now such an entrenched idea that users expect good products to evolve rapidly and serendipitously, continuously challenging their capacity to learn and adapt."

"Every aggressively growing startup seems like a special-forces team with an occupying army of job-eating machine-learning programs and robots following close behind."

"Internally, the software-eaten economy is even more driven by disruption: the time it takes for a disruptor to become a disruptee has been radically shrinking in the last decade - and startups today are highly aware of that risk. That awareness helps explain the raw aggressiveness that they exhibit."

Anything that is in the world when you're born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.

Anything that's invented between when you're fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.

Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.

- Douglass Adams
  
"Specific ideas may fail. Specific uses may not endure. Localized attempts to resist may succeed, as the existence of the Amish demonstrates. Some individuals may resist some aspects of the imperative to change successfully. Entire nations may collectively decide to not explore certain possibilities. But with major technologies, it usually becomes clear very early on that the global impact is going to be of a certain magnitude and cause a corresponding amount of disruptive societal change. This is the path-independent outcome and the reason there seems to be a "right side of history" during periods of rapid technological developments."

"If pastoral visions are so limiting, why do we get so attached to them? Where do they even come from in the first place? Ironically, they arise from Promethean periods of evolution that are too successful."

"When pastoral fantasies start to collapse under the weight of their own internal contradictions, long-repressed energies are unleashed."

Viewed through any given pastoral lens, any unplanned development is more likely to subtract rather than add value.

The existence of thousands of individuals and firms working relatively independently on the same frontier means that every possibility will not only be uncovered, it will be uncovered by multiple individuals, operating with different value systems, at different times and places.

Choosing a problem based on "importance" means uncritically accepting pastoral problem frames and priorities. Constraining the solution with an alluring "vision" of success means limiting creative possibilities for those who come later. Innovation is severely limited: You cannot act on unexpected ideas that solve different problems with the given resources, let alone pursue the direction of maximal interestingness indefinitely. This means unseen opportunity costs can be higher than visible benefits. You also cannot easily pursue solutions that require different (and possibly much cheaper) resources than the ones you competed for: problems must be solved in pre-approved ways.

What makes this a problem-solving mechanism is diversity of individual perspectives coupled with the law of large numbers (the statistical idea that rare events can become highly probable if there are enough trials going on). If an increasing number of highly diverse individuals operate this way, the chances of any given problem getting solved via a serendipitous new idea slowly rises. This is the luck of networks.

The unique characteristics of software as a technological medium have an impact beyond the profession itself. To understand the broader impact of software eating the world, we have to begin by examining the nature of technology adoption processes.

A basic divide in the world of technology is between those who believe humans are capable of significant change, and those who believe they are not. Prometheanism is the philosophy of technology that follows from the idea that humans can, do and should change. Pastoralism, on the other hand is the philosophy that change is profane. The tension between these two philosophies leads to a technology diffusion process characterized by a colloquial phrase popular in the startup world: first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win
