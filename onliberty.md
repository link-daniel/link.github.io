“The Essence of liberty has always lain in the ability to choose as you wish to choose, because you wish so to choose, uncoerced, unbullied, not swallowed up in some vast system; and in the right to resist, to be unpopular, to stand up for your convictions merely because they are your convictions. That is true freedom, and without it there is neither freedom of any kind, nor even the illusion of it.” — Isaiah Berlin

This is a brief on the concept of liberty that I prepared for my exam on political philosophy at the London School of Economics. May it help you in whatever way you deem necessary. It’s not complete, but it’s quite extensive.

It covers negative liberty, positive liberty, republican liberty, political liberty beyond negative liberty, liberty as two concepts, and liberty as an opportunity cost. This is a resource, not an essay.

“Critiques Of” includes philosophers or ideas that challenge the topic. “Importance Of” explains the most important points on the topic from the philosopher’s point of view. And “Excerpts Of”, as the name suggests, offers a few quotes by the philosopher.

### I NEGATIVE LIBERTY

#### CRITIQUE OF:

Berlin (1958)/ Hayek (1960)/ Day (1971)/ Oppenheim (1981)/ Miller (1983)/ Steiner (1994): Most widely cited and best-developed analyses of the negative concept of liberty.

Humboldt/Mill (1859): Comparison between the development of an individual and that of a plant. Individuals like plants must be allowed to grow in the sense of developing their own faculties to the full and according to their own inner logic. Personal growth is something that cannot be imposed from without, but must come from within the individual.

Classical English political philosophers: It is alright to curtail freedom in the interests of other values such as justice, happiness, culture, security or varying degrees of equality.

Locke/ Mill/ Constant/ Tocqueville: There ought to exist a certain minimum area of personal freedom, which must on no account be violated. There needs to be drawn a line between private life and public authority.

Locke/Smith/Mill: Given their optimistic view of human nature, a large reserve of private life is needed over which neither the state nor any other authority can trespass.

Hobbes/Conservatives: Increase centralized control and decrease that of the individual.

Constant (1816): At the very least the liberty of religion, opinion, expression, property must be guaranteed against arbitrary invasion.
Jefferson/Burke/Paine/Mill: Different catalogues of individual liberties, generally keeping authority at bay.

Mill (1869) ‘On Liberty’: The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way.

Mill (1869) ‘On Liberty’: The part which merely concerns himself, civilization cannot advance, the truth will not, for lack of a free market in ideas, come to light; there will be no scope for spontaneity, originality, genius, for mental energy, for moral courage.

Berlin (1958): Mill’s argument for liberty as a necessary condition for the growth of human genius falls to the ground because history suggests that integrity, love of truth and fiery individualism grow at least as often in severely disciplined communities.

Berlin (1958): According to Mill, liberty is not incompatible with some kinds of autocracy, or at any rate with the absence of self-government. 
Liberty in this sense is principally concerned with the area of control, not with its source. Berlin thinks that Mill is wrong because we would still not regard the benevolent despot as unjust considering that he subjects a wide area of liberty.

Berlin (1958): No doubt every interpretation of the word ‘liberty’, however unusual, must include a minimum of what I have called ‘negative liberty’. There must be an area within which I am not frustrated. No society literally suppresses all the liberties of its members.

Burke: he proclaims that the individual’s ‘right’ to be restrained in his own interest, because ‘the presumed consent of every rational creature is in unison with the predisposed order of things’.

Mill (1869): I may forcibly prevent a man from crossing a bridge if there is not time to warn him that it is about to collapse, for I know, or am justified in assuming, that he cannot wish to fall into the water.

Berlin (1958): The craving for status is very close to the desire to be an independent agent.

Skinner (2002): What seems to me particularly valuable about Berlin’s way of stating the case is his insistence that lack of freedom must be categorically distinguished from lack of ability, and that the right way to mark this distinction is to say that we lack freedom only when an action within our power has been rendered impossible or ineligible.

Hobbes: A free man is someone who in those things, which by his strength and wit he is able to do, is not hindred to doe what he has a will to.’

Berlin ‘The Blind Man’: Berlin distinguishes between lack of freedom from inability in a case of a man who cannot read because he is blind. If we apply this distinction between formal and effective freedom, we arrive at the view that the blind man is formally free to read, because no one is interfering with him in this pursuit. But he is not effectively free, since he is not in a position to make use of his formal liberty. On Berlin’s account the blind man is neither formally nor effectively free to read. As Berlin insists, I am free only if I am capable of exercising an ability, should I choose, without interference.

Berlin (1958): Negative liberty offers a truer and more humane ideal than the goals of those who seek in the great disciplined, authoritartian structures the ideal of ‘positive’ self-mastery by classes, or peoples, or the whole mankind.

#### IMPORTANCE OF:

Seeks answer the following question: What is the area within which the subject — a person or group of persons — is or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be, without interference by other persons?

Absence of coercion, which implies the deliberate interference of other human beings within the area in which I could otherwise act.

The degree to which individuals or groups suffer interference from external bodies

Liberal defenses of the constitutional liberties typical of liberal-democratic societies: Freedom of movement, freedom of religion, freedom of speech and in arguments against paternalist or moralist state intervention

Liberty as non-interference: Liberty means not being unprevented from doing as one desires, but that it means being unprevented from doing what one might desire to do

Individual is sovereign: She can pursue he own projects subject only to the constraint that she respect the sphere of others.

Everything is what it is: liberty is liberty, not equality or fairness or justice or culture, or human happiness

If we sacrifice liberty for something like justice or equality, then we experience a loss in individual freedom, and not a gain in some other kind of ‘social’ or ‘economic’ freedom

Both sides of the political spectrum agree that some portion of human existence must remain independent of the sphere of social control. To invade that would be despotism.

The desire not to be impinged upon, and to be left to oneself, has been a mark of high civilization on the part of both individuals and communities.
Freedom is not necessarily connected with democracy. Not necessarily connection between individual liberty and democratic rule.

So understood, negative liberty is an opportunity-concept. Being free is merely a matter of what we can do, what options are open to us, regardless of whether or not we exercise such options (Taylor, 1979).

#### CASE AGAINST:
Individual freedom is not everyone’s primary need

### II POSITIVE LIBERTY

### CRITIQUES OF:
Milne (1968)/ Gibbs (1976)/ Taylor (1979)/ Christman (2005): Most prominent defenders of positive liberty.

Christman (2005): The promotion of positive freedom need not therefore involve the claim that there is only one right answer to the question of how a person should live, nor need it allow, or even be compatible with, a society forcing its members into given patterns of behavior.

Christman (2005): A Muslim women claims to espouse fundamentalist doctrines generally followed by her family and community, yet this person cannot be called free because her desire to conform might be somehow oppressively imposed upon her through indoctrination, manipulation or deceit. She can only be positively free however if her desire to conform was arrived at while being aware of other reasonable options and she weighed and assessed these other options rationally.

Berlin (1958): Positive liberty carries with it a danger of authoritarianism. Consider the fate of a permanent and oppressed minority. Because the members of this minority participate in a democratic process characterized majority rule, they might be said to be free on the grounds that they are members of a society exercising self-control over its own affairs.

Heine (1799): He warned the French not to underestimate the power of ideas; philosophical concepts nurtured in the stillness of a professor’s study could destroy a civilization.

Kant (1788): ‘Nobody may compel me to be happy in his own way.’ Paternalism is ‘the greatest despotism imaginable’ This is so because it is to treat men as if they were not free, but human material for me, the benevolent reformer, to mold in accordance with my own, not their, freely adopted purpose.

Kant (1788): ‘There is no higher value than the individual.’ To manipulate men, to propel them towards goals which you — the social reformer — see, but they may not, is to deny their human essence, to treat them as objects without wills of their own, and therefore to degrade them.

Berlin (1958): The doctrine that maintains that what I cannot have I must teach myself not to desire, that a desire eliminated, or successfully resisted, is as good as a desire satisfied, is a sublime but it seems to me unmistakable for of the doctrine of sour grapes: what I cannot be sure of, I cannot truly want.

Berlin (1958): Self-denial cannot be called an enlargement of liberty.

Spinoza: Children, although coerced, are not slaves because they obey orders given in their own interests and that the subject of a true commonwealth is no slave, because the common interests must include his own.

Fichter: Education must inevitably work in a way that ‘you will later recognize the reasons for what I am doing right now.’ Children cannot be expected to understand why they are compelled to go to school.

Fichter: Compulsion is justified by education for future insight.

Berlin (1958): It is the notion of freedom in its ‘positive’ sense that is at the heart of the demands for national or social self-direction, which animate the most powerful and morally just public movements of our time, and that not to recognize this is to misunderstand the most vital facts and ideas of our age.

R.H. Tawney: The liberty of the strong, whether their strength is physical or economic, must be restrained.

G.A. Cohen: ‘Proletarian Freedom’: The amount of resources might affect your set of choices

Taylor: We can’t just add up the amount of infringements; ask yourself: how much people value choice/ outcome?

Christman (2005): The meaning of freedom is fixed independently of the determination of correct values. This, in turn, indicates that value commitments are not necessary conditions for freedom.

Christman (2005): There may be many cases where I freely pursue a strategy of action that involves constraining my choices and manipulating my values. But if this is part of an autonomous pursuit of a goal, it is implausible to claim that the resulting actions or values do not reflect my autonomy. It cannot be the content of the preference that determines its autonomy.

Christman (2005): I am insisting on the development of a conception of individual positive freedom that avoids these worries of tyranny.
Scanlon (1975): ‘Food Vouchers for those on welfare’ This can be experiences as demeaning by those so singled out and as arrogant by the agent who is taking it upon him — or herself to usurp the judgment and action of the person acted upon. It will undermine the social image and the self-confidence and self-image of the person acted upon.

Doctor who lies to patient about the benefits of a particular treatment in order to get the patient to undergo the treatment: The person constrained by paternalistic laws may also be placed in the power of the paternalizing agent and may feel used for that agent’s purposes. (Counterexample: laws prohibting loans guaranteed on a person’s life or health.

Helmets on motorbikes vs seatbelt laws: The paternalising agent may get it wrong: as a rule, people know best what is in their own interests and what suits their character.

Mill ‘He is the person most interested in his well-being’. The paternalizing agent cannot be trusted to really look after the person’s wellbeing better than the person himself. (Example: In Mill’s time, the idea that women should not be granted too much independence from their husbands, as this would render them unhappy.

Mill ‘On Liberty’: ‘The human faculties of perception, judgment, discriminative feeling, mental activity and even moral preference are exercised only in making a choice. (…) The mental and the moral, like the muscular, powers are improved only by being used. (…) He who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life for him has no need of any other faculty than that of ape-like imitation.’

Plato/Freud: The obstalces to your capacity to act freely may be internal rather than external, and that you will need to free yourself from these psychological constraints if you are to act autonomously.

T.H.Green: Real freedom consists in the whole man having found his object. To attain freedom is thus to have attained ‘harmony with the true law of one’s being’. To speak of the freedom of a man is to speak of ‘the state in which he shall have realized his ideal of himself.’ Freedom is in short the name of an end-state; as Green concludes, it is ‘in some sense the goal of moral endeavour.’

Green & Bosanquet: Green acknowledged that ‘…it must be of course admitted that every usage of the term [i.e., ‘freedom’] to express anything but a social and political relation of one man to other involves a metaphor…It always implies…some exemption from compulsion by another…’
Greenian autonomy-based conception of positive freedom: Nevertheless, Green went on to claim that a person can be unfree if he is subject to an impulse or craving that cannot be controlled. Such a person, Green argued, is ‘…in the condition of a bondsman who is carrying out the will of another, not his own’. Just as a slave is not doing what he really wants to do, one who is, say, an alcoholic, is being led by a craving to look for satisfaction where it cannot, ultimately, be found.

For Greene, a person is free only if she is self-directed or autonomous. Running throughout liberal political theory is an ideal of a free person as one whose actions are in some sense her own. In this sense, positive liberty is an exercise-concept.

R.H. Tawney’s freedom understood as the ability act: on this view of positive freedom, a person who is not prohibited from being a member of a Country Club but who is too poor to afford membership is not free to be a member: she does not have an effective power to act.

### IMPORTANCE OF:

Seeks answer to following question: What, or who, is the source of control or interference that can determine someone to do, or be, this rather than that?

Is passion preventing us from reaching our true self?

Do other people know better what is good for me than I do myself?

Internal factors affecting the degree to which individuals or groups act autonomously

Individualist application of positive liberty: It is sometimes said that a government should aim actively to create the conditions necessary for individuals to be self-sufficient or to achieve self-realization

Positive liberty as growth of individual: The free individual is one that develops, determines and changes her own desires and interests autonomously and from within. This is not liberty merely as the absence of obstacles, but liberty as self-realization. The mere absence of state interference does not guarantee such growth.

The French revolution was an eruption of the desire for ‘positive’ freedom of collective self-direction on the part of a large body of Frenchmen who felt liberated as a nation, even though the result was for a good many of them, a severe restriction of individual freedoms.

Freedom is not freedom to do what is irrational, or stupid, or wrong. To force empirical selves into the right pattern is no tyranny, but liberation.
Imagine two agents who both perform similar morally wrong actions. One does so freely and deliberately and the second acts mindlessly, obediently carrying out the manipulative commands of her hypnotist master. Certainly the first agent is enjoying something of immense value that the second person lacks: the capacity for self-generation and self-government. And this is so despite the equally evil otucomes of both actions. To say then that freedom is a value only in relation to correct moral norms is to ignore the obvious noninstrumental value of self-mastery itself.

Which does freedom require that one give ultimate moral weight to: the maximization of utility or the rational autonomous will?

#### CASE AGAINST:

It is one thing to say that I may be coerced for my own good, which I am too blind to see: this may, on occasion, be for my benefit; indeed it may enlarge the scope of my liberty. It is another to say that if its in my good, then I am not being coerced, for I have willed it, whether I know this or not, and am free even while my poor earthly body and foolish mind bitterly reject it, and struggle with the greatest desperation against those who seek, however benevolently, to impose it.

Conceptions of freedom directly derive from views of what constitutes a self, a person, a man. Enough manipulation of the definition of man, and freedom can be made to mean whatever the manipulator wishes. Recent history has made it only too clear that the issue is not merely academic.
Paternalism is despotic, not because it is more oppressive than naked, brutal, unenlightened tyranny, nor merely because it ignores the transcendental reason embodied in me, but because it is an insult to my conception of myself as a human being, determined to make my own life in accordance with my own purposes, and, above all, entitled to be recognized as such by others. For if I am not recognized, then I may fail to recognize, I may doubt, my own claim to be a fully independent human being.

Paternalistic policies and the reasons for and against them: they single people out as a) insufficiently well informed, or b) less capable of managing their own affairs than some third party, or c) less capable of arriving at the correct judgment of what is good for them
By interfering with autonomy, it undermines the goods of autonomy: Pub closing laws in Britain may have infantilized the population

### III REPUBLICAN LIBERTY

#### CRITIQUES OF:
Pettit (2001) / Skinner (2002): Freedom is not merely the enjoyment of a sphere of noninterference but the enjoyment of certain conditions in which such non-interference is guaranteed. Republican freedom should be defined as nondomination, not noninterference.

Skinner (2002) ‘Neo-Roman’: I am free only if I live in a society with the kinds of political institutions that guarantee the independence of each citizen from exercises of arbitrary power.

Pettit (2001): Republican freedom did not think of freedom in a positive sense: in particular, did not see it as being tied definitionally to participation in a self-determining polity.

Skinner (2002): Republican authors had argued for a negative conception of freedom as noncoercion and noninterference, not a positive conception.
Pettit (2001): The republican conception of freedom was certainly negative but it did not represent liberty as noninterference in the manner that Hobbes inaugurated and that came to prominence among 19th century liberal writers.

Skinner (2002): Republicans had cared about dependency on the good will of another, even dependency in the case where there is no actual coercion.
Skinner (2002): Your rulers may choose not to exercise these powers, or may exercise them only with the tenderest regard for your individual liberties. So you may in practice continue to enjoy the full range of your civil rights. The very fact, however, that your rulers possess such arbitrary powers means that the continued enjoyment of your civil liberty remains at all times dependent on their goodwill.

Pettit (2001): Someone has an arbitrary power of interference in the affairs of another so far as they have a power of interference that is not forced to track the avowed or readily avowable interests of the other: they can interfere according to their own arbitrium or decision.

Pettit (2001): ‘The Kindly Master vs The Nonarbitrary Law’ To rate domination without interference (the kindly master) as worse than interference without domination (the nonarbitrary law).

Pettit (2001): Where he contrasts freedom with a composite antonym of nondomination and noninterference, I contrast it with the single antonym of nondomination.

Pettit (2001): a) There is no Rousseauvian sort of paradox involved in identifying freedom with nondomination. b) Domination has other effects besides restricting choice that make it inimical to freedom c) Freedom should be thought to require not just nondomination and noninterference but also nonlimitation

Pettit (2001): The dominant connotation of freedom, emphasized in the long republican tradition, was not having to live in servitude to another: not being subject to the arbitrary power of another. The ideal liberty-protecting government, then, ensures that no agent, including itself, has arbitrary power over any citizen. The key method by which this is accomplished is through an equal disbursement of power. Each person has power that offsets the power of another to arbitrarily interfere with her activities. Unlike negative liberty, republican liberty is primarily focused upon ‘defenseless susceptibility to interference, rather than actual interference’

Larmore (2001): Republican liberty is not primarily concerned with rational autonomy, realizing one’s true nature, or becoming one’s higher self. When all dominating power has been dispersed, republican theorists are generally silent about these goal.

Skinner: Republican liberty as an alternative to liberalism. (However, insofar as republican liberty is seen as a basis for criticizing market liberty and market society, this is plausible (Gaus, 2003b). However, when liberalism is understood more expansively, and not so closely tied to either negative liberty or market society, republicanism becomes indistinguishable from liberalism.)

#### IMPORTANCE OF:
Republican freedom as a status: To be a free person is to enjoy the rights and privileges attached to the status of republican citizenship, whereas the paradigm of the unfree person is the slave. Freedom is not simply a matter of non-interference, for a slave may enjoy a great deal of non-interference at the whim of her master. What makes her unfree is her status, such that she is permanently liable to interference of any kind. Even if the slave enjoys non-interference, she is dominated because she is permanently subject to the arbitrary power of her owner.

Republican freedom as distinct from positive liberty: a) It does not consist in the activity of virtuous political participation rather, that participation is seen as instrumentally related to freedom as non-domination. b) The republican concept of freedom cannot lead to anything like the oppressive consequences feared by positive liberty (Berlin), because it has a commitment to non-domination and to liberal-democratic institutions already built into it.

### IV POLITICAL LIBERTY BEYOND NEGATIVE LIBERTY

#### CRITIQUES OF:
Constant/ Humboldt/ Spencer/ Mill: Positive liberty is not part of political freedom.

Rousseau/ Hegel/ Marx/ T.H. Green: Positive liberty is part of political freedom.

Berlin (1958): You lack political liberty only if you are prevented from attaining a goal by human beings. Mere incapacity to attain a goal is not lack of political freedom.

Locke (1689): ‘Where there is no law, there is no freedom’, because rational law is a direction to a man’s ‘proper interests’ or ‘general good’; and adds that since law of this kind is what ‘hedges us in only from bogs and precipices’ it ‘ill escape from it as being irrational, forms of ‘license’, as ‘brutish’ and so on.

Montesquieu/Kant: Political liberty is not about being permitted to do what we want, or even what the law allows, but only ‘the power of doing what we ought to will’

Berlin (1958): This is the argument of every dictator, inquisitor and bully: I must do for men what they cannot do for themselves, and I cannot ask their permission or consent, because they are in no condition to know what is best for them; indeed what they will permit and accept may mean a life of contemptible mediocrity, or perhaps even their ruin or suicide.

Mill: ‘The tyranny of the majority’. Government by the people was not necessarily freedom at all.

Berlin (1958): But the fathers of liberalism — Mill and Constant — want more than this minimum: they demand a maximum degree of non-interference compatible with the minimum demands of social life. In reality, most people have sacrificed liberty for other values such as security, prosperity, fraternity, virtue etc.

Mill/Constant/Tocqueville: What makes a society free? 1) No power, but only rights, can be regarded as absolute right, so that all men, whatever power governs them, have an absolute right to refuse to behave inhumanly 2) There are frontiers, not artificially drawn, within which men should be inviolable, these frontiers being defined in terms of rules so long and widely accepted that their observance has entered into the very conception of what it is to be a normal human being and therefore also of what it is to act inhumanly or insanely

Berlin (1958): The belief that one entity has a final solution is responsible for the slaughter of individuals on the altars of the great historical ideals

Berlin (1958): Equally it seems to me that the belief that some single formula can in principle be found whereby all the diverse ends of men can be harmoniously realized is demonstrably false.

Constant: ‘It is not against the arm that one must rail, but against the weapon’ The transference by a successful rising of unlimited authority, commonly called sovereignty, from one set of hands to another does not increase liberty, but merely shifts the burden of slavery. It does not matter who holds authority, but how much authority should placed in anybody’s set of hands

Constant: ‘Popular government is merely a spasmodic tyranny, monarchy a more centralized despotism.’

Petiti (2001): Any theory that goes beyond freedom with nondomination will have to identify it with nonlimitation of any kind; it cannot find a stable resting point in the identification of freedom with a joint ideal of nondomination and noninterference

Feinberg: ‘Paternalism is derogatory and tendentious’. It suggests the view that the agent in question stands to the other agenst as a parent stands to its children, and that normal adults might be properly treated as if they are children.

Mill ‘On Liberty’: ‘His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant [for interference with hisliberty or autonomy]. He cannot be rightfully compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise or even right. There are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. (…) In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.’

Raz (The Morality of Freedom): The success of a person’s life is judged not only by the success of his projects but also by how he came to have them’
Emerson: Self-fulfilment is the person’s highest good in life, and this cannot be achieved by someone else for them.

Feinberg: Authenticity: Can subject her tastes and plans to rational scrutiny and reject those that are not her own; the remaining motives are those she identifies with as her own. Self-control: The person is capable of directing herself towards the ends she has authentically chosen

Mill ‘Freedom Generates Experiments in Living’: These experiments are good, because if successful, they may point the way towards good news ways of living that others may have good reason to adopt. If they fail, they provide others with deeper knowledge of why avoiding these way of living is good, and therefore possibly a better a deeper appreciation of the ways in which one should live.

A true anti-hard-paternalist would simply have to appeal not to the goods of autonomy or the evils of interference, but to a person’s basic right to self-governance, which allows him to do as he pleases as long as he is competent and well-informed.

Feinberg (Harm to Self): When the exercise of a person’s sovereign right conflicts with what is truly good for him, [this appeal to the basic right of self-governance] defends the choice nonetheless. If that seems an absurd result, the reader should put himself in the position of the person interfered with. Presumably, if he genuinely chose the alternative that is in fact bad for him, he did not choose it because he believed it was bad for him. That would be so irrational that it would put the voluntariness of his choice in doubt, and as we shall see, the soft-paternalistic strategy might then be used to justify interference on liberal grounds. If he chose that alternativebecause he believed it good (or at least not bad) for himself, then either the difference between him and his would-be constrainers is over some matter of fact about which he is simply mistaken, in which case he would welcome being set right, or it is about the nature of his self-interest, or the reasonableness, given his values, of the risks he wishes to assume. In that case, the disagreement would be more intractable, and the reader would not welcome having his own judgment overruled, or the “better values” of others substituted for his own. There is still another possibility. The person may have chosen to act as he did despite believing the consequences would be bad for his self-interest. Perhaps he wishes to sacrifice “his own good,” or some part of it, for the sake of others, or for some treasured cause; or perhaps he deliberately values short-term good over his future good in the long run. Identifying with the person in one of those cases, does the reader genuinely prefer “suppression for his own good” over facilitation of his own fully informed choice? If not, how then can he have a different preference for others? Even in the cases where the person subsequently regrets his choice, he may not regret that he had not been forcibly prevented from making it. There must be a right to err, to be mistaken, to decide foolishly, to take big risks, if there is to be any meaningful self-rule; without it, the whole idea of de jure autonomy begins to unravel.

Cass Sunstein’s and Richard Thaler’s ‘Libertarian paternalism’: If we frame people’s choices or set the default option in a way that makes them choose what we have reason to think is in their interest then we are being paternalistic without limiting their freedom. (Examples: enrolment in advantageous pension plan with option to opt-out versus default non-enrolment and opt-in; or default enrolment in paying for parking from pre-tax dollars; default contract 2-week holiday with optional extra 2-week holiday versus default contract 4-week holiday with optional forgoing of 2 week holiday.

Skinner (2002): I do not agree with Berlin’s assumption that, whenever we speak about negative liberty, we must be speaking about absence of interference. It seems to me that , we have inherited two rival and incommensurable theories of negative liberty.

Skinner (2002): Perhaps the idea of liberty as absence of interference was truer to the society in which Berlin was writing, in which the ideal of freedom as self-perfection had come to be widely seen as a religious and collectivist nightmare from the free world had thankfully awoken. But in earlier periods the same ideal had been a dream, not a nightmare, and in many western societies of present time there are new movements of religious faith in which the positive concept of liberty may well appear to answer to far deeper purposes than the negative idea of merely having as much elbow-room as we desire. The question of which concept best answers to our purposes will always depend on what account if any we believe should be given of the normative character of human nature.

Berlin (1958): In thinking about the concept of liberty ‘I am well aware of how much more needs to be done.’

Ghandi: Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes.

Talmon: One concept fundamental to both “liberal” and “totalitarian” democracy is that to liberty. According to Talmon, totalitarian democracy sees freedom as something achieved only in the long term, and only through collective effort; the political goal of ultimate order and ultimate harmony brings ultimate freedom. In addressing every aspect of the lives of its citizens, the totalitarian democratic state has the power to ensure that all material needs are met from cradle to grave, and all that is required of the citizen is to carry out his role, whatever it may be, to the best of his ability. Liberal democracy, on the other hand, posits freedom as something that can and should be achieved by the individual in the short term, even at the expense of things such as material well-being, and sees as an element of this freedom a “freedom from government” wherein the individual is able to exercise “freedom” in his own terms to the extent that they do not contravene the law. Proponents of both kinds of democracy argue that their particular approach is the best one for the citizens of their respective countries.

#### IMPORTANCE OF:

Democratic society as a self-determined society: a member of that society is free to the extent that he or she participates in its democratic process.

Epicurus: Knowledge liberates

Self-realization: We are enslaved by despots, — institutions, or beliefs or neuroses –, which can be removed only by being analyzed and understood.
Freedom as self-mastery: Freedom is self-mastery, the elimination of obstacles to my will, whatever these obstacles may be — the resistance of nature, of my ungoverned passions, of irrational institutions, of the opposing wills or behavior of others.

The freedom of rational self-direction

Men who have fought for freedom have commonly fought for the right to be governed by themselves or their representatives
In cases where Y is well-informed and suffiecently capable of rational self-governed action, it can never be a good or relevant reason for some agent X to interfere with the liberty or autonomy of person Y without Y’s consent that this interference will promote Y’s good.

‘Soft Paternalism’ Lack of information (Mill’s collapsing bridge case) or Cognitive limitations of otherwise normal adults (i.e. temporary drunkenness): In cases where X has good reason to believe that Y is not well-informed and/or insufficiently capable of rational self-governed action, and only in such cases, it is always a good and relevant reason for some agent X to interfere with the liberty or autonomy of person Y without Y’s consent that this interference will promote Y’s good.

### V LIBERTY AS TWO CONCEPTS

#### CRITIQUE OF:
Kant (1788): Earliest proponent of dual meaning of liberty

Berlin (1958): ‘What governs me?’ is logically distinct from the question ‘How far does government interfere with me? It is in this difference that the great contrast between the two concepts of negative and positive liberty, in the end, consists.

Berlin (1958): “Negative and positive liberty are not merely two distinct kinds of liberty; they can be seen as rival, incompatible interpretations of a single political ideal.

MacCallum (1967) ‘Berlin’s artificial dichotomy’: There is in fact only one basic concept of freedom, on which both sides in the debate converge. What the so-called negative and positive theorists disagree about is how this single concept of freedom should be interpreted.

MacCallum (1967) ‘Freedom as a triadic relation: A subject, or agent, is free from certain constraints, or preventing conditions, to do or become certain things. A relation between three things: an agent, certain preventing conditions, and certain doings or becomings of the agent. Any statement about freedom or unfreedom can be translated into a statement of the above form by specifying what is free or unfree, from what it is free or unfree, and what it is free or unfree to do or become. Any claim about the presence or absence of freedom in a given situation will therefore make certain assumptions about what counts as an agent, what counts as a constraint or limitation on freedom, and what counts as a purpose that the agent can be described as either free or unfree to carry out.

Berlin (1958): This makes it clear why the definition of negative liberty as the ability to do what one wishes will not do. If I find that I am able to do little or nothing of what I wish, I need only contract or extinguish my wishes, and I am made free. If the tyrant manages to condition his subjects into losing their original wishes and embracing the form of life he has invented for them, he will on this definition, have succeeded in liberating them. However he has created the very antithesis of political freedom.

Berlin (1958): Negative liberty wants to curb authority as such while positive liberty want it placed in its own hands. These are not two different interpretations of a single concept, but two profoundly divergent and irreconcilable attitudes to the ends of life. It is important to recognize this, even though in reality we need to strike a compromise.

Christman (2005): The distinction between this idea and the concept of negative liberty is between seeing freedom as simply the absence of restraints and seeing freedom as the capacity for self-mastery and self-government
Benson (1987): Without proper attention to external (correct) norms of behavior, agents lack freedom. A child, for example, does not have an understanding of the correct norms applying to her action.

Raz: “Autonomy is not enough’ The distinction between the two different ideals of self-realization and autonomy is important. Joseph Raz raises the distinction, stating that although autonomy is a factor that contributes to self-realization, “[t]he autonomous person is the one who makes his own life, and he may choose the path of self-realization or reject it. Nor is autonomy a precondition of self-realization, for one may stumble into a life of self-realization or be manipulated into it or reach it in some other way which is inconsistent with autonomy.”

Flikschuh: ‘Inspiration from both’ Perhaps the best way in which to conceive of liberal freedom is not to think that one can subscribe to a version of either the negative or the positive variety. Perhaps divergent liberal freedom conceptions all occupy the space in between these two (not wholly accurate) historical poles, with some conceptions lying closer to one extreme than the other, but with all of them drawing inspiration, to varying degrees, from both sides.

#### IMPORTANCE OF:
‘The Divided Self’ anecdote: He drives to buy cigarettes, and is free to do so, but he is driven by his passion. Are his actions then truly free?
External and Internal: It is useful to think of the difference between the two concepts in terms of the difference between factors that are external and factors that are internal to the agent.

Illustration of freedom as a triadic relation: If we say that the driver is free, what we shall probably mean is that an agent, consisting the driver’s empirical self, is free from external (physical or legal) obstacles to do whatever he or she might want to do. If, on the other hand, we say that the driver is unfree, what we shall probably mean is that an agent, consisting in a higher or rational self, is made unfree by internal, psychological constraints to carry out some rational, authentic or virtuous plan. Notice that in both claims there is a negative and positive element; each claim about freedom assumes both that freedom is freedom from something (ie. preventing conditions) and that it is freedom to do or become something. The dichotomy between ‘freedom from’ and freedom to’ is therefore a false one, and it is misleading say that those who see the driver as free employ a negative concept and those who see the driver as unfree employ a positive one. What these two camps differ over is the way in which one should interpret each of the three variables in the triadic freedom-relation. More precisely, we can see that what they differ over is the extension to be assigned to each of the variables.

A whole range of interpretations: A number of classic authors cannot be placed unequivocally in one or the other of the two camps. Locke, for example, is normally thought of as one of the fathers or classical liberalism and therefore as a staunch defender of the negative concept of freedom. He indeed states explicitly that to be at ‘liberty is to be free from restraint and violence from others’. But he also says that liberty is not to be confused with ‘license’, and that ‘ill deserves the name of confinement which hedges us in only from bogs and precipices’. While Locke gives an account of constrants on freedom that Berlin would call negative, he seems to endorse an account of MacCallum’s third freedom-variable that Berlin would call positive, restricting this to actions that are not immoral and to those that are in the agent’s own interests. Therefore, it is conceptually and historically misleading to divide theorists into two camps — a negative liberal one and a positive non-liberal one.

If I believe the ends of men are many and not all of them are in principle compatible with each other, then the possibility of conflict and of tragedy can never wholly be eliminated from human life, either personal or social.

Pluralism, with negative liberty that it entails is truer than ‘positive’ self-mastery by classes, peoples or the whole of mankind because it does at least recognize the fact that human goals are many, not all of them commensurable, and in perpetual rivalry with one another.

In the end, men choose between ultimate values; they choose as they do because their life and thought are determined by fundamental moral categories and concepts that are, at any rate over large stretches of time and space, and whatever their ultimate origins, a part of their being and thought and sense of their own identity; part of what makes them human

It may be that the ideal of freedom to choose ends without claiming eternal validity for them, and the pluralism of values connected with this, is only the late fruit of our declining capitalist civilization

### VI LIBERTY AS AN OPPORTUNITY CONCEPT

#### CRITIQUES OF:
Taylor (1979): If one thinks of freedom as involving self-direction one has in mind an exercise concept of freedom as opposed to an opportunity-concept. If interpreted as an exercise concept, freedom consists not merely in the possibility of doing certain things, but in actually doing certain things in certain ways — for example, in realizing one’s true self or in acting on the basis of rational and well-informed decisions.
